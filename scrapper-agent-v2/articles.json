        "content": "“Debanking” has been happening behind the scenes for years but is back in the\npublic conversation\n, with many individuals, policymakers, companies, and — most importantly for U.S. innovation —\nentrepreneurs\ncoming forward on the issue. Since the crypto industry and specific agencies have come up again and again in this conversation, here’s a quick explainer on the phenomenon to help separate the signal from the noise.\nBut first, what is “debanking”?\nSimply put, debanking is when a law-abiding person or entity unexpectedly loses their banking relationship, potentially being kicked out of the banking system.\nDebanking is different than when an entity loses banking services because they are suspected or confirmed — after some investigation or other process — to be engaging in fraud, money laundering, or other\nillicit\nactivity\n.\nDebanking can occur without any apparent investigation, detailed explanation, or advance notice that would provide the entity enough time to move their funds. Most importantly: there is no due process, appeal process, or other recourse.\nWhy does it matter, in the big picture?\nWe already have fair banking rules that try to ensure that people aren’t discriminated against — on the basis of age, gender, marital status, national origin, race, religion, and more. But no such rules limit banks (or their regulators) from denying or revoking someone’s right to banking services at whim.\nDebanking can therefore be used as a tool or weapon systematically wielded by specific political actors/ agencies against private individuals or industries without due process. Imagine if the government decided who could or couldn’t get electricity merely because of their politics, or some arbitrary reason… without having to explain, investigate, notify, or offer recourse. That’s what’s happening with debanking.\nWhy debank?\nNot every closing of a bank account is “debanking”. Banks can justifiably close their clients’ bank accounts for many reasons, including if they believe those clients are engaged in suspicious activity. Banks may also proactively choose to reduce their regulatory compliance costs and efforts by limiting their exposure to certain individuals, industries, or business models.\nHowever, this type of legitimate activity is not what’s raising red flags around debanking. Rather, many of the debanking concerns come from reports of regulatory authorities unlawfully wielding their power by placing undue influence on banks to drop clients in certain industries — or to drop clients with political affiliations or interests those political authorities don’t like. This enables those regulators to exert authority over industries, even though Congress never authorized that authority.\nBanks often acquiesce to this pressure because they don’t want to be adversarial with the regulators that oversee them. Many banks also don’t want to deal with the compliance headaches — or additional examinations — that their banking regulators could levy on them if they fail to comply.\nWhere does ‘Operation Choke Point’ come in?\nIn 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice\nwas found\nto have launched — as a policy initiative of the president’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force — a probe into fraud and money laundering against certain businesses. This marked a\nshift in strategy\nfor the government: Instead of targeting individual firms for wrongdoing, the government was now issuing subpoenas to the banks and payments companies about their clients who were running high-risk or politically disfavored — but legal — businesses.\nIn other words, the government was using its regulatory oversight to improperly “choke off” access to financial services and shut down accounts — in order to stifle businesses in industries the administration didn’t favor (\nas observed by\nthe then-head of the U.S. banking industry trade association, the American Bankers Association). In his 2014\nop-ed\nfor the\nWall Street Journal\n, Frank Keating — former president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, former Oklahoma Governor, and chairman emeritus of the Board of the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center — observed:\nWhen you become a banker, no one issues you a badge, nor are you fitted for a judicial robe. So why is the Justice Department telling bankers to behave like policemen and judges? Justice’s new probe, known as ‘Operation Choke Point’, is asking banks to identify customers who may be breaking the law or simply doing something government officials don’t like.\nThe program was ostensibly shut down the following year following\nlegal\n, congressional, and agency backlash.\nToday, the phrase “Operation Choke Point 2.0” is sometimes\nused\nto refer to the government debanking “political enemies and disfavored tech startups”, to\nput it\none way. Or as others\nput it\n, the term refers to a bank “cutting ties with a customer deemed politically incorrect, extreme, dangerous, or otherwise out of bounds”. Regardless of how the term is defined, it is an issue affecting entities at either end of, and across, the political spectrum.\nWhich agencies are involved?\nThe inner workings of Operation Choke Point — and any other related or subsequent systematic efforts to debank specific entities or industries — have not previously been clear to anyone, since investigations if any were conducted behind closed doors, and FOIA\nrequests\nare still pending. But, on\nDecember 6\n, a court filing in one such FOIA case revealed that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) instructed at least one bank (in a letter dated March 11, 2022): “…at this time the FDIC has not yet determined what, if any, regulatory filings will be necessary for a bank to engage in this type of activity. As a result, we respectfully ask that you pause all crypto asset-related activity.” There were numerous FDIC letters filed in the case as exhibits to the record.\nMeanwhile, we already knew that the original Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (2013) which implemented Operation Choke Point “1.0” included the FDIC, and Department of Justice (DOJ), among others. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) — an independent bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury — was also apparently involved, as was the U.S. central banker, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been\ncited\nas well.\nNote: The U.S. government isn’t alone in debanking. Other governments like Canada have\nused\nthe tactic; and\nthe U.K.\nhas had to\ninvestigate complaints\nof government-led debanking as well.\nWhy would the government do this, and what are the effects?\nThe reasons cited for debanking range from tackling payment processor fraud to preventing risky businesses from doing business, since those businesses may be perceived to be more associated with money laundering. Rather than being referred to as “debanking”, these reasons are more often\ndescribed as\nde-risking\n: “the practice of financial institutions terminating or restricting business relationships indiscriminately with broad categories of clients, rather than analyzing and managing the risk of clients in a targeted manner”.\nApplied in a broader sense, de-risking and debanking can be used as “\na partisan tool\n” to kill legal businesses for\npolitical\nreasons alone. Still another reason may be that certain government agencies want more\ndiscretion\nand authority on deciding “where and under what circumstances consumers can obtain loans, financial products, and other banking services”.\nTo be clear, the issue isn’t about a specific government agency doing their job. The issue is about government\noverreach\n(or\ngeneral\nabuse of power) against legitimate businesses — without any meaningful due process or the\nability to\ncurtail their actions, which often take place behind closed doors. Especially since sufficient laws and legal methods\nalready exist\nto regulate businesses for legitimate reasons like providing consumer protection, preventing money laundering, and stopping other criminal violations.\nUsing debanking as a tactic has many unintended consequences. Even if the goal were to truly protect consumers and the banking system, the results can backfire by impeding consumer choice, or by having\na chilling effect\non commerce overall. Such practices also undermine the U.S. government’s own policy objectives, as observed in\na report\n(2023) on de-risking from The Department of Treasury, by:\ndriving financial activity out of the regulated financial system;\nhampering remittances, or delaying the unencumbered transfer of international development funds and humanitarian/ disaster relief;\npreventing low- and middle-income segments of the population — as well as other underserved communities — from efficiently accessing the financial system; and\nundermining the centrality of the U.S. financial system.\nFinally, using the tactic of debanking can punish legitimate businesses and people merely by association. Take for instance the example of\nsomeone having\ntheir previously approved mortgage revoked simply because they worked for an open source foundation in the crypto industry.\nFor all of the reasons listed here, many have described the\npractice\nof debanking as “un-American”. It’s certainly anti-innovation when indiscriminately aimed at emerging technologies.\nWhat is the scope of the problem?\nWhile we can’t speak for an entire industry or particular interest, we as a VC in the\ncrypto industry\nhave seen, first-hand, at least 30 instances of debanking occur with our portfolio companies and founders over the last four years. Coinbase also\npublicly shared\nthat they had uncovered at least “20 examples of the FDIC telling banks to ‘pause’ or ‘refrain from providing’ or ‘not proceed’ with offering crypto-banking services”.\nThere are likely many more cases. The issue has been unreported since many entrepreneurs and small businesses have been hesitant to come forward, due to fear of further repercussions or lack of resources to fight the issue.\nFor our portfolio companies, many debankings happened to pre-revenue — and pre-token — companies. Their bank accounts received VC funding (which came via institutions like pension funds and university endowments), and those companies were spending those funds on employee salaries and ordinary business expenses — just like other tech startups.\nSo what were the reasons these companies were told, either in writing or (more often) verbally? Cited reasons ranged from “we aren’t banking crypto” to more commonly: “Your account is being closed for compliance related issues. Please move all funds immediately.” The companies were also told this without receiving any specifics on which specific “compliance” issue, and without the ability to remedy if there really were an issue. Finally, other reports we received from our companies include:\nbeing told that “the business compliance back office team shut down the account and prohibited us from opening any other accounts. No other reason was stated and there is no appeals process”;\nbeing rejected for “lack of trust in all people running crypto companies”;\nreceiving unfounded inquiry letters and notices, creating costly cycles and undue stress for startups — which are already operating leanly compared to larger companies.\nWhat can you do?\nPlease continue to share your stories publicly; we continue to track incidents. You can also reach out to relevant partners you are in touch with here for further resources and support.\nWe’d also like to thank the banking partners (as well as legal counsel and others) who have been diligent — and took the time to build logical and thoughtful underwriting capabilities — by striving to understand the underlying business models and risks involved in any individual company. We know who you are, and thank you.\nAcknowledgments: Michele Korver , Miles Jennings, and Emily Westerhold; thanks also to Paul Cafiero, David Sverdlov, and Aiden Slavin\nEditor: Sonal Chokshi\n***"

        "title": "A few of the things we’re excited about in crypto (2025)",
        "url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/big-ideas-crypto-2025/",
        "content": "Editor’s note: a16z released its omnibus\nlist\nof “big ideas” tech builders may tackle in the year ahead, according to partners across AI, American Dynamism, bio/ health, crypto, enterprise, fintech, games, infrastructure, and other areas. Below is a shortlist of some of the things that excite our various a16z crypto partners about what’s ahead. And for a 2025 outlook on policy, regulation, and more, check out this November 2024\npost\n.\nBe sure to also\nsubscribe to our newsletter\nfor more trend updates, builder guides, industry reports, and other resources.\nAn AI needs a wallet of one’s own to act agentically\nAs AIs make the transition from NPCs (non-playing characters) to being the\nmain\ncharacters, they will begin to act as agents. However, until very recently, AIs haven’t been able to act truly agentically. And they are still unable to participate in markets — exchange value, reveal preferences, coordinate resources — in a verifiably autonomous (read: not human-controlled) way.\nAs we’ve seen, AI agents (\nlike @truth_terminal\n)\ncan\nuse crypto to transact, which opens up all kinds of creative content opportunities. But there’s even more potential for AI agents to become more useful — both in fulfilling human intents, and in becoming standalone network participants. As networks of AI agents begin to custody their own crypto wallets, signing keys, and crypto assets, we’ll see interesting new use cases emerge. Such use cases include AIs operating or verifying nodes in\nDePIN\n(decentralized physical infrastructure networks) — for example, to help with distributed\nenergy\n. Other use cases range from AI agents becoming real, high-value game players. We may eventually even see the first AI-owned and operated blockchain.\n—Carra Wu\n@carrawu on Twitter | @carra on Farcaster\nEnter ‘decentralized autonomous chatbots’\nBeyond AI owning wallets, there’s an\nAI chatbot\nrunning a\nTEE\n(trusted execution environment). TEEs provide an isolated environment where applications can be executed, allowing more secure distributed system design. But in this case, the TEE is used to prove that the bot is autonomous, not controlled by human operators.\nExtending this further, the next big idea here would be what we’re calling a\ndecentralized autonomous chatbot\nor DAC (not to be confused with\ndecentralized autonomous corporation\n). Such a chatbot could build a following by posting appealing content, whether\nentertaining\nor informative. It would build a following on decentralized social media; generate income in various ways from the audience; and manage its assets in crypto. The relevant secret keys would be managed in a TEE that also runs the chatbot software — which means that no one has access to those secret keys other than that software.\nAs risks develop, regulatory guardrails may be necessary. But the key point here is decentralization: Running on a permissionless set of nodes, and coordinated by a consensus protocol, the chatbot could even become the first truly autonomous billion-dollar entity.\n—Dan Boneh, Karma, Daejun Park, and Daren Matsuoka\n@danboneh on Twitter\n@0xkarmacoma on Twitter | @karma on Farcaster\n@daejunpark on Twitter\n@darenmatsuoka on Twitter | @darenmatsuoka on Farcaster\nAs more people use AI, we’ll need unique proof of personhood\nIn a world of online impersonations, scams, multiple identities, deepfakes, and other realistic yet deceptive AI-generated content, we need “proof of personhood” — something to help us know that we’re interacting with an actual person. The new problem here isn’t fake content, however; what’s new is the ability to now produce that content at much lower cost. AI radically decreases the\nmarginal cost\nof producing content that contains all the cues we use to tell if something is “real”.\nSo now, more than ever, we need methods to digitally link content to people, privately. “\nProof\nof personhood\n” is an important building block in establishing digital identity. But here, it becomes a mechanism for\nincreasing\nthe marginal cost of attacking a person or undermining the integrity of a network: Obtaining a unique ID is free for humans, but costly and difficult for AIs.\nThat’s why the property of privacy-preserving “uniqueness” is the next big idea in building a web we can trust. Solving for more than just proving personhood, it fundamentally changes the cost structure of attacks for malevolent actors. The “uniqueness property” — or Sybil resistance — is therefore a non-negotiable property of any proof of personhood system.\n—Eddy Lazzarin\n@eddylazzarin on Twitter | @eddy on Farcaster\nGoing from prediction markets… to better information aggregation for everything\nPrediction markets hit the main stage in 2024 with the U.S. elections, but as an economist who studies\nmarket design\n, I don’t believe it’s prediction markets per se that will be transformative in 2025. Rather, prediction markets\nset the stage for more\ndistributed technology-based\ninformation aggregation mechanisms\n— which can be used in applications ranging from community governance and sensor networks to finance and much more.\nThis past year proved the concept, but note that prediction markets themselves\naren’t always\na great way to aggregate information: Even for global, “macro” events, they can be unreliable; for more “micro” questions, prediction pools can be too small to get meaningful signal. But researchers and technologists have decades’ worth of\ndesign frameworks\nfor incentivizing people to (truthfully) share what they know in different information contexts — from data\npricing\nand\npurchasing\nmechanisms, to a “\nBayesian\ntruth\nserum\n” for eliciting subjective assessments — many of which have already been applied in crypto projects.\nBlockchains have always been a natural fit for implementing such mechanisms — not only because they’re decentralized, but\nbecause\nthey facilitate open, auditable, incentive schemes. Importantly, blockchains also make the outputs public, so the results\ncan be interpreted in real-time\nby everyone.\n—Scott Duke Kominers\n@skominers on Farcaster | on Twitter\nEnterprises will increasingly accept stablecoins for payments\nStablecoins\nfound product-market fit\nin the past year — not surprising since they are the cheapest way to send a dollar, enabling fast global payments. Stablecoins also provide more accessible platforms for entrepreneurs building new payments products: no gatekeepers, minimum balances, or proprietary SDKs. But large enterprises have not yet woken up to the substantial cost savings — and new margins — available to them by switching to these payment rails.\nWhile we’re seeing some enterprise interest in stablecoins (and early adoption in peer-to-peer payments), I expect to see a bigger experimentation wave in 2025. Small-/medium-sized businesses with strong brands, captive audiences, and painful payment costs — like restaurants, coffee shops, corner stores — will be the first to switch from credit cards. They don’t benefit from credit card fraud protection (given in-person transactions), and are also the most hurt by transaction fees (30 cents per coffee is a lot of lost margin!).\nWe should also expect larger enterprises to adopt stablecoins as well. If stablecoins indeed speedrun\nbanking\nhistory, then enterprises will attempt to disintermediate payment providers — adding 2% directly to their bottom line. Enterprises will also start seeking new solutions to problems credit card companies currently solve, like fraud protection and identity.\n—Sam Broner\n@sambroner | @sambroner\nCountries explore putting government bonds onchain\nPutting government bonds onchain would create a government-backed, interest-bearing, digital asset — without the surveillance concerns of a CBDC (central bank digital currency). These products could unlock new demand sources for collateral usage in DeFi (decentralized finance) lending and derivatives protocols, adding further integrity and soundness to those ecosystems.\nSo as pro-innovation governments around the world further explore the benefits and efficiencies of public, permissionless, and irrevocable blockchains this year, some countries may trial issuing government bonds onchain. The UK, for instance, is already exploring digital securities through a sandbox at their financial regulatory body, the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority); its HM Treasury/ Exchequer has also signaled its interest in issuing digital gifts.\nIn the U.S. — given that the SEC is set to require clearing treasuries through legacy, burdensome, and costly infrastructure next year — expect more conversations around how blockchains could increase transparency, efficiency, and participation in bonds trading.\n—Brian Quintenz\n@brianquintenz on Twitter | @brianq on Farcaster\nWe’ll see greater adoption of the ‘DUNA’, a new industry standard for blockchain networks in the U.S.\nIn 2024, Wyoming passed a new law recognizing DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) as legal entities. The\nDUNA\nor “decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association” was\npurpose-built\nto enable decentralized governance of blockchain networks, and is the only viable structure for U.S.-based projects. By incorporating a DUNA into a decentralized legal entity structure, crypto projects and other decentralized communities can empower their DAOs with legal legitimacy — enabling\ngreater economic activity\n, as well as insulating token holders from liability and also managing tax and compliance needs.\nDAOs — the communities that govern the affairs of an open blockchain network — are a necessary tool for ensuring that networks remain open, do not discriminate, and do not unfairly extract value. The DUNA can unleash the potential of DAOs, and several projects are already working on implementing it. With the U.S. poised to foster and accelerate progress for its crypto ecosystem in 2025, I expect the DUNA will become a standard for U.S. projects. We also expect other states to adopt similar structures (Wyoming led the way; they were also the first state to adopt the now-ubiquitous LLC)… especially as other decentralized applications beyond crypto (like for\nphysical infrastructure\n/ energy grids) take off.\n—Miles Jennings\n@milesjennings on Twitter | @milesjennings on Farcaster\nLiquid democracy online goes physical\nAs people become increasingly dissatisfied with current governance and voting systems, there’s now a window of opportunity to experiment with new, tech-enabled governance — not just online, but in the\nphysical world\n. I’ve written before about how DAOs and other decentralized communities are allowing us to\nstudy\npolitical institutions, behavior, and\nrapidly evolving\ngovernance experiments at scale. But what if we could apply these learnings to physical-world governance through blockchains?\nWe could finally use blockchains to carry out secure, private voting for elections, beginning with low-stakes pilots to limit cybersecurity and auditing concerns. But importantly, blockchains would also allow us to experiment with “liquid democracy” — a way for people to vote directly on issues, or to delegate their votes — at the local level. The idea was first proposed by Lewis Carroll (author of\nAlice in Wonderland\nand also a prolific researcher of voting systems); however, it was impractical at scale… until now. Recent advances in computing and connectivity, as well as blockchains, enable new forms of representative democracy. Crypto projects have already been applying this concept, yielding tons of data on what makes these systems work – see results from our recent research\nhere\n– that local governments and communities could borrow from.\n—Andrew Hall\n@ahall_research on Twitter | on Farcaster\nBuilders will reuse, not just reinvent, infrastructure\nThis past year, teams continued to reinvent the wheel across the blockchain stack — with yet another bespoke validator set, consensus protocol implementation, execution engine, programming language, RPC API. The outcomes were sometimes slightly better in specialized functionality, but often lacked in broader or baseline functionality. Take for instance a specialized programming language for SNARKs: While an\nideal\nimplementation may let an\nideal\ndeveloper produce more performant SNARKs, in practice it could fall short of general purpose languages (at least currently) on compiler optimizations, developer tooling, online learning materials, AI programming support … and may even lead to\nless\nperformant SNARKs.\nThat’s why I expect more teams to leverage the contributions of others, reusing more off-the-shelf blockchain infrastructure components in 2025 — from consensus protocols and existing staked capital to proof systems. Not only will this approach help builders save lots of time and effort, it will allow them to relentlessly focus on differentiating the value of their product/ service.\nThe infrastructure is finally here to build primetime-ready web3 products and services. And as with other industries, these will be built by the teams that can navigate complex supply chains successfully, rather than the teams who scoff at anything “not invented here”.\n—Joachim Neu\n@jneu_net on Twitter\nCrypto companies will begin with the end (-user experience), instead of letting the infrastructure determine the UX\nWhile blockchain technical infrastructure is interesting and varied, many crypto companies aren’t just\nchoosing their infrastructure\n— the infrastructure is in some ways choosing for them, and therefore their users, when it comes to UX (user experience). That’s because specific technical choices at the infrastructure level correlate directly with the resulting UX of a blockchain product/ service.\nBut I believe the industry will overcome the ideological barrier implied here: That technology should decide the ultimate UX, vs. the other way around. In 2025, more crypto product designers will begin with the end-user experience they want, and\nthen\nchoose the appropriate infrastructure from there. Crypto startups no longer have to over-index on specific infrastructure decisions before finding\nproduct-market fit\n— they can focus on actually\nfinding\nproduct-market fit.\nInstead of getting caught up in specific EIPs, wallet providers, intent architectures, etc., we can abstract away these choices into a holistic, full-stack, plug-and-play approach. The industry is ready for this: abundant programmable blockspace, maturing developer tooling, and chain abstraction are beginning to democratize who can design in crypto. Most technology end-users don’t care what language something is written in to use that product every day. The same will begin to happen in crypto.\n—Mason Hall\n@0xMasonH on Twitter | @mason on Farcaster\n‘Hiding the wires’ helps usher in web3’s killer app\nThe industry’s technical superpowers are what make blockchains so special, yet have also hindered mainstream adoption to date. For\ncreators\nand fans, blockchains unlock connectivity, ownership, and monetization… But industry-insider jargon (“NFTs,” “zkRollups”, etc.) — and complex design — puts up barriers for those who benefit most from the technologies. I’ve seen this firsthand in countless conversations with media, music, and fashion executives interested in web3.\nMass adoption for many consumer technologies has followed this path: began with the technology; some iconic company/ designer abstracts away the complexity; the move helps unlock some breakthrough app. Think about where email started — SMTP protocols hidden behind the “send” button; or credit cards, where most users today don’t think about the payment rails. Similarly, Spotify revolutionized music not by flaunting file formats — but by delivering song playlists to our fingertips. As Nassim Taleb observed, “Over-engineering breeds fragility. Simplicity scales.”\nThat’s why I think our industry will adopt this ethos in 2025: “hide the wires”. The best decentralized apps are already focusing on more intuitive interfaces, to become as easy as tapping a screen or swiping a card. In 2025, we’ll see more companies design simply and communicate clearly; successful products don’t explain; they solve.\n—Chris Lyons\n@chrislyons on Twitter | on Farcaster\nThe crypto industry finally gets its own appstores, and discovery\nWhen crypto apps get blocked by centralized platforms like Apple’s App Store or Google Play, it limits their top-of-funnel user acquisition. But we’re now seeing newer app stores and marketplaces provide this kind of distribution and discovery, and without gating. For instance, Worldcoin’s World App marketplace — which not only stores proof-of-personhood but allows access to “mini apps” — enabled 100,000s of users for several apps within just a few days. Another example is the fee-free dApp Store for\nSolana mobile phone\nusers. Both of these examples also show how hardware, not just software — phones, orbs — may be the key advantage for crypto app stores… just like Apple devices were for early app ecosystems.\nMeanwhile, there are other stores with 1000s of decentralized applications and web3 developer tools across popular blockchain ecosystems (e.g., Alchemy); as well as blockchains acting as both publisher\nand\ndistributor for gaming (c.f. Ronin). However, it’s not all fun and games: If a product has existing distribution — like on messaging apps — it’s hard to port that over onchain (exception: Telegram/TON network). The same is true of apps with significant web2 distribution. But we may see more of this porting happening in 2025.\n—Maggie Hsu\n@meigga on Twitter | @maggiehsu on Farcaster\nCrypto owners become crypto users\nIn 2024, crypto saw major developments as a\npolitical\nmovement, with key policymakers and politicians speaking positively about it. We also continued to see it develop as a\nfinancial\nmovement (see for example how Bitcoin and Ethereum\nETPs\nbroadened investor access). In 2025, crypto should further develop as a\ncomputing\nmovement. But where do those next users come from?\nI believe now is the time to re-engage the currently “passive” crypto holders and convert them into more active users, because only 5-10% of people\nowning\ncrypto are actively\nusing\ncrypto. We can bring\nthe 617 million people\nwho already own crypto onchain — especially as blockchain infrastructure continues to improve, resulting in lower transaction fees for users. This means new applications will start to emerge for existing and new users. Meanwhile, the early applications we’ve already seen — across categories like stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, gaming, social, DePIN, DAOs, and prediction markets — are starting to become more accessible to mainstream users as well, as the community focuses much more on user experience and other improvements.\n—Daren Matsuoka\n@darenmatsuoka on Twitter | on Farcaster\nVarious sectors may start tokenizing ‘unconventional’ assets\nAs costs decrease due to maturing infrastructure in the crypto industry and other emerging technologies, the practice of tokenizing assets will spread widely across sectors. This will allow assets that were previously deemed inaccessible — due to high costs, or lack of recognition as valuable — to not only potentially achieve liquidity, but more importantly, participate in the global economy. AI engines could also consume this information as unique datasets.\nJust as fracking unlocked oil reserves once considered unreachable, tokenizing unconventional assets could redefine income generation in the digital age. Seemingly sci-fi scenarios become more possible as a result: For instance, individuals could tokenize their own biometric data; and then lease the information through smart contracts to companies. We are already seeing early examples of this through\nDeSci\ncompanies bringing more ownership, transparency, and consent into medical data collection using blockchain technology,\nfor instance\n. We have yet to see how such a future would play out, but these types of developments would allow people to capitalize on previously untapped assets in a decentralized manner — as opposed to relying on governments and centralized intermediaries to provision them for them.\n—Aaron Schnider\n@aaronschnider on Twitter\nEditor: Sonal Chokshi\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

They see the potential for decentralized systems to create a democratized, user-controlled internet that promotes competition, while safeguarding user freedoms and rewarding contributors, creators, and other participants.\nCrypto’s value proposition isn’t just hypothetical, it’s tangible: Crypto projects are already giving people ownership over their\ndigital identities\n, helping creators\nmonetize their work\n, and providing\nnew ways\nfor small businesses like restaurants to engage with their customers. More and more, policymakers on the left and right are seeing how crypto can help combat Big Tech overreach by democratizing AI, by offering user-controlled alternatives to centralized social media platforms, by decentralizing physical infrastructure like energy grids, and more.\nAt the highest levels of both parties, lawmakers are leaning in. “We all believe in the future of crypto,” Senate Majority Leader\nChuck Schumer (D-NY)\nhas said\n: “I want to bring members on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate together…so we can pass sensible [crypto] legislation that helps the United States maintain its status as the most innovative country in the world.” Senator Schumer’s remarks dovetail with recent statements from President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to make the U.S. the “\ncrypto capital of the planet\n.”\n2. Government needs to pass laws and enact regulation\nLegislators from both major parties acknowledge that the crypto market needs laws — and the time to pass them is now.\nSenator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Representative Patrick McHenry (R-NC)\nsay\nthat passing a comprehensive market structure bill for crypto is a top priority. “We just can’t wait anymore, Europe is way ahead of us,” Sen. Lummis says. Their Democratic colleague Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) concurs,\nsaying that\nrepresentatives have been “working hard to develop a comprehensive cryptocurrency framework.” As does Democratic Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA), who underscores the problematic ambiguity of the status quo,\nsaying that\ncrypto builders “are focused on innovating and creating jobs in the U.S. An already difficult task made tougher without clear guardrails or regulation.”\nThese recent affirmations come amid a wave of progress toward the development of bipartisan crypto market structure legislation. New law would help clarify how regulators should treat digital assets and whose jurisdiction they would fall under. Earlier this year, the U.S. House of Representatives\npassed\none such bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (\nFIT21\n), with overwhelming bipartisan support. Seventy-one House Democrats\nvoted in favor\nof this landmark bill, which would give blockchain-based projects a pathway to safely and effectively launch in the U.S., while incentivizing decentralization and safeguarding users.\nCongress is now poised to build on this momentum and finally pass market structure legislation. Clear rules of the road would foster decentralized innovation, protect consumers by regulating centralized intermediaries operating in crypto markets, and establish swimlanes for the regulatory agencies overseeing these markets.\n3. Stablecoins strengthen the U.S. and advance America’s interests at home and abroad\nStablecoins are tokens whose price is pegged, often to a currency. They offer users a frictionless, low-to-no-fee way to transfer value at the speed of the internet. Millions of people around the world\nhave already\ntransacted trillions of dollars using stablecoins to make cross-border payments, transact online, engage in decentralized finance (DeFi), and more.\nStablecoins offer opportunities for users and businesses, and also for the country. The vast majority of stablecoin transactions involve two assets: USDT and USDC, both of which are pegged to the U.S. dollar. As foreign sovereign digital currencies compete for traction, stablecoins — 99% of which are\ndenominated in USD\n, thereby\nstrengthening the U.S. dollar’s status globally — have already found product-market fit.\nPolicymakers from both major parties are recognizing the need to update rules in light of stablecoins’ adoption. During a recent Securities and Exchange Commission oversight hearing, the House Financial Services Committee’s ranking Democrat Maxine Waters (D-CA)\ncalled\na stablecoin bill “long overdue” and asserted that “we can reach a deal that prioritizes strong protections for our nation’s consumers and strong federal oversight.” Representative McHenry agreed,\nresponding\nthat he aims to “come to terms on stablecoin legislation this Congress.”\nEffective stablecoin legislation would advance America’s interests and help foster secure, transparent, and consumer-friendly markets at home and abroad. Commonsense protections would include requiring issuers to fully back their tokens with high-quality liquid assets such as cash or U.S. treasuries, and requiring their reserves to be regularly audited by independent third-parties. Rules for stablecoins would also establish robust requirements for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, and they would use the\ninherent traceability\nof blockchains to combat illicit finance.\nCrucially, legislation should also allow builders to create\ndecentralized stablecoins\n, since these can rely on assets that exist natively on a blockchain where they are generally free from the counterparty risks that arise from custodying assets with intermediaries. Without third parties, such stablecoins can achieve true decentralization, taking advantage of its\nnumerous benefits\n.\n4. Everyone has the right to a bank account — even crypto companies\nOperation chokepoint (1.0) was a\nconcerted effort\nby the Department of Justice, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to shutter controversial businesses by cutting off their access to the banking system. In its initial manifestation, the operation targeted payday lenders, coin dealers, gun shops, and marijuana dispensaries — all of which are legal businesses.\nLeveraging similar tactics, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 has sought to curtail the crypto industry by restricting crypto businesses’ and their associated individuals’ access to banks. Pressure from policymakers including Senator\nElizabeth Warren\n(D-MA), agencies such as the\nFederal Reserve, FDIC, OCC,\nand others have attempted to cut off crypto businesses’ access to the banking system. On multiple occasions, federal banking agencies have also\nasserted\nthat issuing or holding crypto as principal is likely inconsistent with sound banking practices. Certain banks were even\nadvised\nto limit their own crypto offerings, according to documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.\nAs with Operation Chokepoint 1.0, crypto businesses are not being punished for breaking the law, but rather for being out of favor with certain policymakers and regulatory agencies. Fortunately, lawmakers are now aware of the overreach. In a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN)\nasserted\nthat “there’s been a coordinated chorus of regulators talking about severing crypto from our financial system,” while drawing a comparison to the original Operation Choke Point.\nThere is now emerging bipartisan consensus that federal agencies have effectively — and capriciously — restricted crypto firms’ access to banking services. Regulators should immediately end this approach, which constrains legitimate businesses’ access to essential financial infrastructure.\n5. We need to fight bad actors and curb illicit activity\nMedia coverage of crypto too often emphasizes\nallegations of money laundering\n, while ignoring the technologies’ exciting and innovative uses. These stories mislead: Blockchain analytics firms\nestimate\nthat transactions associated with illicit activity made up only 0.34% of all cryptocurrency activity in 2023 and 0.42% in 2022 — and these figures equate to just a tiny fraction of the dollar’s use in illicit finance.\nOf course, bad actors may still use blockchain networks for illicit transactions, just as cyber criminals use computer networks to steal people’s data and bank robbers use cars and highway networks to conduct heists. Crime is not the fault of these technologies. Criminal activity can be addressed through tailored, effective, law enforcement efforts that mitigate illicit finance risk while realizing the benefits of these technologies.\nPerhaps the most pressing threats that need to be addressed are cybersecurity-related hacks and thefts by sanctioned state actors like the DPRK. Lawmakers agree that better guardrails are required to combat bad actors — especially rogue states such as the DPRK — from exploiting crypto for their gain. The Treasury Department has already\nsignaled support\nfor several steps that the government can take to stem attacks by bad foreign actors, which we’ve\noutlined here\n. That includes augmenting the government’s ability to crack down on foreign bad actors by amending the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) to clearly authorize extraterritorial jurisdiction under certain circumstances. It also includes enhancing Treasury’s enforcement capacities to address compliance failures.\n***\nCrypto is bipartisan. Democrats, republicans, and independents share common ground on many of the industry’s most pressing issues. We hope that this list helps clarify that, while Americans may disagree about a lot of things, crypto shouldn’t be one of them. Broad and growing support for the industry now exists, as well as a commitment to providing the regulatory clarity needed for crypto to deliver on its promise of creating a democratized user-controlled internet.\n***\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

        "title": "16 insights from New York Times bestseller Read Write Own",
        "url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/read-write-own-book-excerpts/",
        "content": "Looking for a better understanding of the tech, business, and startup worlds? A primer on the history and future of the internet? A crisp explanation of the crypto and blockchain movements, and why they matter? We’ve got you.\nHere, we’ve gathered some of the sharpest excerpts and most provocative ideas from the\nNew York Times\nBest Seller\nRead Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet\n. The book is densely packed with insights about the hidden structures that dictate the flow of power and money online. Author and a16z crypto Founder and Managing Partner Chris Dixon draws on his decades-long career investing in startups to reveal what makes the networks that determine so much of our lives tick, as well as how they can be rewired to empower internet users and transform them into\nowners\n.\nThe ideas in\nRead Write Own\nexplore new ways of thinking that can advance you in business and in life — from cultivating innovation, to staying ahead of disruption, to placing contrarian bets. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has called the book “a compelling vision of where the internet should go and how to get there.” Whether you’re passionate about crypto, playing catch-up, or simply curious to learn what all the to-do is about, the book offers something for everyone.\nHere are some of the most compelling excerpts, each a valuable takeaway in itself.\n1. The nature of permission\nIn business, permission seeking is not like asking your parents or teachers for permission, where you get a simple yes or no answer. Nor is it like traffic lights setting the rules of the road. In business, permission becomes a pretense for tyranny. Dominant tech businesses leverage the power of permission to thwart competition, desolate markets, and extract rents. (p. xvi)\n2. Software as art\nSoftware is so expressive that it is better thought of not as engineering but as an art form. The plasticity and flexibility of code offer an immensely rich design space, far closer in the breadth of possibilities to creative activities like sculpting and fiction writing than engineering activities like bridge building. As with other art forms, practitioners regularly develop new genres and movements that fundamentally shift what’s possible. (p. xx)\n3. The problems blockchains solve\nThe ability for blockchains to make strong commitments about how they will behave in the future allows\nnew networks\nto be created. Blockchain networks solve problems that plague earlier network architectures. They can connect people in social networks while empowering users over corporate interests. They can underpin marketplaces and payment networks that facilitate commerce, but with persistently lower take rates. They can enable new forms of monetizable media, interoperable and immersive digital worlds, and artificial intelligence products that compensate — rather than cannibalize — creators….\nAsking “What problems do blockchains solve?” is like asking “What problems does steel solve over, say, wood?” You can make a building or railway out of either. But steel gave us taller buildings, stronger railways, and more ambitious public works at the outset of the Industrial Revolution. With blockchains we can create networks that are fairer, more durable, and more resilient than the networks of today. (pp. xxiii–xxiv)\n4. A new internet era\nThe decisions we make now will determine the internet’s future: who builds, owns, and uses it; where innovation happens; and what the experience will be for everyone. Blockchains, and the networks they enable, unlock the extraordinary power of software as an art form, with the internet as its canvas. The movement has an opportunity to change the course of history, to remake humanity’s relationship to the digital, to reimagine what’s possible…. This is a chance to create the internet you want, not the internet you inherited. (p. xxviii)\n5. The supremacy of networks\nNetwork design is destiny.\nNetworks are the organizing framework that enables billions of people to intelligibly interact. They decide the world’s winners and losers. Their algorithms decide where money and attention will flow. The structure of a network guides how that network will evolve and where wealth and power accumulate. Given the scale of the internet today, software design decisions up front, regardless of how seemingly small, can have cascading downstream consequences. Who controls a given network is the central question when analyzing power on the internet. (p. 3)\n6. Protocols vs. corporations\nThe difference between a protocol network like email and a corporate network like Twitter is that email’s network effect accrues to a community instead of a company. No company owns or controls email and anyone can access it through software created by independent developers that supports the underlying protocol. It’s up to developers and consumers to decide what to build and use. Decisions that affect the community are made by the community. (p. 18)\n7. The impact of new technologies\nPeople use new technologies in one of two ways: (1) to do something they could already do but can now do faster, cheaper, easier, or higher quality; or (2) to do something brand-new that they simply couldn’t do before. Early in the development of new technologies, the first category of activities tends to be more popular, but it’s the second set that has more lasting effects on the world. (p. 27)\n8. The corporate-controlled internet\nCorporate networks have a simple structure. In the middle, a company controls centralized services that power the network. This company has complete control. It can rewrite its terms of service, determine who has access, and redirect how money flows, at any time, for any reason. Corporate networks are centralized because there is ultimately one person, usually the chief executive officer, who makes all the rules. (p. 31)\n9. Blockchains as non-consensus bet\nBlockchains are different. They’re a non-consensus bet. While plenty of people recognize their potential — including me — much of the establishment disregards them. In fact, a prevailing view in the tech industry assumes that the only vectors of technological improvement that matter are the ones incumbents are already focused on: bigger databases, faster processors, larger neural networks, smaller devices. The view is myopic. (p. 52)\n10. How hobbies fuel future industries\nOutside-in technologies arrive, in contrast, on the fringes. Hobbyists, enthusiasts, open-source developers, and startup founders hatch them outside the mainstream. The work usually involves less capital and formal training, which helps level the playing field with insiders. A lower bar also causes insiders to take these technologies and their proponents less seriously…. Hobbies fuel future industries…. Hobbies are what the smartest people spend time on when they aren’t constrained by near-term financial goals. I like to say that what the smartest people do on the weekends is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years. (pp. 53–54)\n11. The simplicity of tokens\nWhat tokens\nare\nmatters less than what they\ndo\n.\nTokens can represent the ownership of anything digital, including money, art, photos, music, text, code, game items, voting power, access, or whatever people come up with next. Using some additional building blocks, they can also represent real-world things, like physical goods, real estate, or dollars in a bank account. Anything that can be represented in code can be wrapped inside a token to be bought, sold, used, stored, embedded, transferred, or whatever else a person might want to do with it. If that sounds so simple as to seem trivial, that’s by design. Simplicity is a virtue. (p. 72)\n12. Owners vs. users\nThe concept of ownership is so deeply embedded in our lives that it’s difficult to imagine how the world would look if that were taken away. Imagine if the clothes you bought could be worn only in the venue you bought them in. What if you couldn’t resell or reinvest in your house or car? Or what if you had to change your name wherever you went? This is the digital world of corporate networks. (p. 80)\n13. Blockchains as cities\nBlockchain functions have neat analogues in urban planning. Starting a blockchain network is like building a new city on undeveloped land. The city designer constructs some initial buildings and then designs a system of land grants and tax incentives for residents and developers. Property rights — ownership — play a key role, providing strong commitments that property owners will get to keep what they own and can feel comfortable investing in it. As the city grows, so does the tax base. Taxes are reinvested into public projects like streets and parks, more land is given away, and the city grows. (p. 97)\n14. Restoring community through tokens\nBlockchain networks bake community ownership into their core design. It’s in their DNA. While memecoin mutations, like Dogecoin, may seem like a joke, they show how users are embracing all sorts of tokens — some silly, some serious — in search of community, to fill the void left by corporate networks. The internet was originally envisioned as a decentralized network owned and controlled by its participants. Tokens restore that vision. (p. 140)\n15. Blockchains as network constitutions\nNetwork designers can use blockchains to create formal rules that are enforced by code. These rules are like constitutions for networks. What these constitutions say is subject to debate, contention, and experimentation, but their very existence, the ability to enshrine rules in immutable software, is a meaningful advance that was not possible in previous network designs.\n(p. 167)\n16. Crypto’s two cultures\nTwo distinct cultures are interested in blockchains. The first sees blockchains as a way to build new networks…. I call this culture the\ncomputer\nbecause, at its core, it’s about blockchains powering a new computing movement. … The other culture is mainly interested in speculation and money-making. Those of this mindset see blockchains solely as a way to create new tokens for trading. I call this culture the\ncasino\nbecause, at its core, it’s really just about gambling. … The casino should not hold the computer down. (pp. 171, 181)\nBonus: The good old days\nBlockchains are at the computing frontier, as PCs were in the 1980s, the internet was in the 1990s, and mobile phones were in the 2010s. People look back today on classic moments in computing and wonder what it was like to be there. Noyce and Moore. Jobs and Wozniak. Page and Brin. Hobbyists dabbling, debating, driving forward. Tinkerers hacking away on nights and weekends.\nWhat seems late is actually early. Now is the time to reimagine what networks can be and what they can do. Software is an un- beatable playground for ingenuity. You don’t have to accept the internet as you found it. You can make something better . . . as a builder, as a creator, as a user, and, most important, as an owner.\nYou are here now. These are the good old days.

If you use\nExo Labs\nyou can do AI inference using multiple of these simply hooked up to your home network. It’s crazy easy and a lot of fun for someone who wants to dive deep into an AI homelab on easy mode.\nIf you want to get a little deeper into the weeds with non-Apple hardware, Turing Pi has a cool ITX board that you can put four of these Raspberry Pi-like SBCs (single-board computers) into for a home cluster. It’s ideal if you want to mess with ARM chips or setups that involve coordinating across 4–16 separate computers with pretty impressive specs for the price.\n–\nEddy Lazzarin, CTO\nDappnode (\nlink\n)\nPerfect for the crypto enthusiast who is interested in becoming a solo staker and running a validator node at home. I set one up during the holidays last year. DappNode offers an out-of-the-box device that makes it fairly easy to get started, versus doing so from scratch. Still, it is not for the faint of heart. I found myself troubleshooting issues on more than one occasion. But hey, after running it for just a year, I’ve since recouped my investment through staking rewards — and isn’t it nice knowing you’re supporting the next generation of the internet?\n–\nRobert Hackett, editorial team\nDaylight computer (\nlink\n)\nThe Daylight computer is essentially an Android tablet with a highly modified display so it looks like an e-ink screen, but at 60 fps (frames per second) and with a spectacular weeklong battery life. If you want a nice, minimal tablet with an e-ink experience and crazy battery life and pen, I think it’s a winner.\n–\nEddy Lazzarin, CTO\nDeep work machine.

It can climb stairs. It can do flips. It can dance. If it’s hooked up to an LLM it can talk. It can teach you quantum physics. It will follow you. It’s autonomous. They have a version that’s on wheels that can go like 30 mph. It’s very compelling. On flat ground it goes on the wheels, but if it needs to climb stairs it just locks the wheels and it goes back to being able to climb stairs and walk on uneven surfaces, so it’s completely flexible.\n–\nMarc Andreessen, cofounder and general partner\nWaveshare e-ink raw displays (\nlink\n)\nI have a handful of these three color e-ink displays from waveshare and they’re such a blast to turn into little side projects. All it takes is a raspberry pi and the display. I keep a display\nin my kitchen\nwith the news and weather, but the possibilities are limitless.\n–\nSam Broner, deal team\nChargers and cables\nAnker charging brings (735,\nlink\n), and (737,\nlink\n) —\nunder $50\nThe Anker 735 (Nano II 65W) is a revelation. Slightly bigger than AirPods, but with three ports. It fully charges my phone in ~30 minutes and my computer in ~2 hours. And they only cost $40!

That with an\nAnker charging block\n(above!) is *chef’s kiss*.\n–\nHelen Stoddard, events team\nFashion\nAccessories\nCatbird Custom Jewelry: Build your own jewelry (\nlink\n)\nA beautiful timeless way to share something truly one of a kind and personal. Made in the USA using recycled 14k gold.\n–\nBrittney Burrows, events team\nLanbrella umbrella (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nReally sturdy and decently compact umbrella with a C handle so you can put it around your arm and keep your hand free. Folds inverted so you don’t get wet, and has a car glass breaker for safety. –\nMax Kesten, events team\nRay-Ban Meta Wayfarer smart glasses (\nlink\n)\nI use these primarily to listen to music on walks and phone calls. It’s better than AirPods especially when walking in the city because you are still aware of your surroundings.\n–\nMichael Blau, deal team\nThese remain underrated imo. The video/photo quality is awesome and the audio quality is stunning given it has to shoot the audio into your ears from the temples of the glasses. Unfortunately there’s no way to disable the irritating LED that remains lit when recording video, which makes the glasses riskier to use in public than a conventional camera or phone camera. I have two pairs both with prescription lenses (very easy to do with Lenscrafters) — one sunglasses, one regular glasses. I love these things.\n–\nEddy Lazzarin, CTO\nBags and backpacks\nAer city pack (\nlink\n)\nI’m not gonna say that I have the best travel backpack ever made ever, but I will say it’s the best I’ve ever owned and I did WAY too much research.\nThis is a great brand for tech travel gear without over packing or looking super dorky.\n–\nHelen Stoddard, events team\nCu\nyana Leather Tote\n(\nlink\n)\nThe zipper on this tote makes it perfect for travel and you can also add on a washable insert to give the tote more structure and organization.\n–\nBrittney Burrows, events team\nThe Patagonia Black Hole Mini MLC 30L\n(\nlink\n)\nThis backpack is better than all other backpacks. It’s small enough to fit under an airplane seat, large enough to fit everything you’d want on a long flight or day hike. Chest and waist straps for ergonomics, and as a bonus you can carry it as a shoulder bag or a briefcase.\n–\nMichael Zhu, engineering team\nFitness and self-care\nEquipment\nAssault Bike (\nlink\n)\nA brutal piece of equipment.\n–\nAaron Schnider, operations team\nBarbell clips (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nHate when I’m at the gym searching around for barbell clips. Slows down time between sets. These are great.\n–\nIsh Verduzco, marketing team\nHand exercise grip (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nGreat way to keep working on hand and forearm strength during calls and meetings. –\nIsh Verduzco, marketing team\nFitness trackers and health monitors\nThe Garmin Fenix 8 (\nlink\n)\nThe Garmin Fenix 8 is my most used, most loved piece of tech. From tracking just about every sport imaginable to rock solid GPS to detailed sleep tracking and a 14-day-plus battery life, the Fenix 8 never leaves my wrist. –\nJason Rosenthal, crypto startup accelerator (CSX)\nLevels continuous glucose monitor (CGM) (\nlink\n)\nSee in real-time how your blood sugar reacts to food. Super insightful with different foods and your genetic makeup.\n– Aaditya Shidham, deal team\nNeurode (\nlink\n)\nBrain gym to enable focus without pharma intervention. Super useful for those with ADHD, but interesting for those without as well.\n–\nAaditya Shidham, deal team\nOura ring (\nlink\n)\nIt’s fairly standard, but I use my Oura ring all the time to track my health data.\n– Ali Yahya, deal team\nFuel\nCowboy colostrum (\nlink\n)\nI put vanilla cowboy colostrum in yogurt or in a smoothie each day. I think it improves my hair and skin as well as my immune system.\n–\nEm Westerhold, operations team\nLMNT electrolytes (\nlink\n)\nMy favorite extra SALTY electrolytes. LMNT is great first thing in the A.M. and pre + post running, lifting, or the sauna. Helps combat travel fatigue too. The citrus flavor also makes a tasty margarita.\n–\nShari Doherty, marketing team\nHair, nail, and skincare\nBoie flat body scrubber (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nI love this because it’s sensitive, stays clean forever, and is easy to use.\n–\nMax Kesten, events team\nGua Sha tool (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nFor facial massage — because we are all in looks maxxing mode now.\n–\nJustin Simcock, security team\nJolie shower filter (\nlink\n)\nThis shower filter is easy to install and it removes chlorine and other contaminants that strip out the natural oils in our hair and skin. Auto renew will send you a new filter every quarter.\n– Casey Graul, recruiting team\nOlive and June Nail System (\nlink\n)\nI never had a home manicure last over a week until this brand! Highly recommend.\n–\nBrittney Burrows, events team\nThe Ordinary Hair Density Serum (\nlink\n)\nThe Ordinary’s multi-peptide serum for hair density helped strengthen my hair, with lots of new growth showing. It took a few bottles to see results but the price is great.\n–\nBrittney Burrows, events team\nSkull Shaver (\nlink\n)\nJust trying to be like Ben and Marc 🙂\n–\nAaron Schnider, operations team\nRecovery and TLC\nBurdick chocolate (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nExquisite, and utterly delicious.\n–\nScott Duke Kominers, research team\nDynamic Saunas home sauna with infrared lighting (\nlink\n)\nFor the health and wellness lovers! Infrared sauna has so many great health benefits. Good quality, easy to install, and doesn’t take much room. It has a Bluetooth sound system too.\n– Casey Graul, recruiting team\nMebak 3 massage gun (\nlink\n)\nGreat Theragun dupe that comes with a bunch of attachments for different body parts. My favorite treatment for after a tough workout, hike, or just to relax.\n–\nMax Kesten, events team\nTherabody Theragun (\nlink\n)\nBecause I’m old and have many aches and pains these days.\n–\nAaron Schnider, operations team\nWashable reusable wet bags (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nGreat for post-workout sweaty clothes!\n–\nMax Kesten, events team\nGaming & fun\nConsoles and hardware\nSteam Deck OLED (\nlink\n), or limited edition white (\nlink\n)\nValve has put an unbelievable amount of work into ensuring that the Steam Deck can play the vast majority of PC games listed on Steam’s marketplace. It is actually amazing to play top-tier PC games on this console, and the new OLED display extends (the somewhat poor) battery life into acceptable territory. Highly recommended for people who want to play the best quality games (PC games!) in a mobile format.\n–\nEddy Lazzarin, CTO\nSteam Deck is still my favorite on-the-go gaming device. Whether you’re visiting family or just lazing around at home, it’s a great way to play more casual games.\n– Sagar Dhawan, engineering team\nTeenage Engineering OP-XY field sequencer (\nlink\n)\nThe hotly anticipated sequel to the popular OP-1 field sequencer, sampler, and keyboard. I don’t have it yet — it’s in the mail — but I’ll be trying it as soon as it arrives!\n–\nEddy Lazzarin, CTO\nGames\nDeadlock (Valve game in pre-alpha) (\nlink\n)\nValve’s new game Deadlock is still in pre-alpha but is a refreshing take on MOBAs (multiplayer online battle arenas). For me as a first-person shooter guy, it gives me an entirely new format of game to play. (Folks can\nreach out to me\nand I’m happy to share invites).\n– Sagar Dhawan, engineering team\nDrone racing simulators such as\nLiftOff (Steam,\nlink\n) or\nVelocidrone (\nmobile app,\nlink\n)\nA sim (and real controller) is the best starting place to learn drone racing without breaking the bank on thousands of dollars of equipment. For FPV (first-person view) drone stuff you typically train up using LiftOff and a controller that has a left stick that attaches easily to a computer.\nThe best controller I have used for sim was the FrSky Taranis Q X7, Radiomaster Pocket (ELRS), or Radiomaster Boxer (ELRS)\n–\nMatt Gleason, security team\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 (\nlink)\nFly from the comfort of your home and maybe experience a warmer location? 🙂\n–\nSagar Dhawan, engineering team\nMore racing simulators, games, and related hardware\nIt’s the best time of the year to get into sim racing. When most of the country is too cold for any real outdoor racing, the sim racing community comes alive. There’s a lot of deals on sim racing gear during this time of year. If you already have a PC — it doesn’t get better than\niRacing\nfor competitive racing and\nForza Motorsport\nfor more casual play. Otherwise\nGran Turismo\non the PS5 is really good too. I can also recommend the\nF1 games\nas they will go on sale towards the end of the year (and end of the F1 season in a few weeks).\nHardware-wise I’d recommend exploring direct drive wheel and pedal bundles from\nMoza\nor\nFanatec\n.\n– Sagar Dhawan, engineering team\nPortable Go game set (\nlink\n)\n—\nunder $50\nI’ve been playing a ton of Go on this travel board. I like that it’s just 9×9 and 13×13 sizes, which is perfect for beginners. It’s surprisingly high quality for the very low price.\n– Mason Hall, deal team\nBOOZUU SpaceX Falcon-Heavy Rocket Building Set (\nlink\n)\n— under $50\nIt’s very cool. —\nKatherine Boyle, a16z general partner and American Dynamism cofounder\nHome\nBedding\nCozy Earth Cuddle Blanket (\nlink\n)\nSimple, everyday luxury — soft, breathable, and perfect for unwinding. Whether you’re on the couch or in bed, it’s the kind of comfort you’ll never want to let go of.\n– Chris Lyons, deal team\nThe Eight Sleep Pod 4 (\nlink\n)\nMy friends have raved about Eight Sleep for years and I always thought of it as a gimmick or gadget that I didn’t need. Then, I tried it and on the first night had the best sleep of my life. Now, I can’t imagine ever going back. I sleep best when the mattress is ice cold but my wife likes it nice and toasty. With Eight Sleep, we can both have it our way. –\nJason Rosenthal, crypto startup accelerator (CSX)\nCleaning\nLevoit cordless vacuum cleaner (\nlink\n)\nGreat dupe to the Dyson cordless vacuum. Charges fast, swivels well, goes flat to reach hard areas. Makes vacuuming much easier.\n– Max Kesten, events team\nMiele Complete C3 Calima vacuum (\nlink\n)\nBuck the trend of unreliable bagless vacuums. Who wants to scoop dust out of a canister with their bare hands? Why are we doing this to ourselves? Get yourself a vacuum with a bag. This Miele vacuum picks up every little nightmare mess my four-year-old can make, including rice pulverized into a sort of glue and then ground into the carpet, changing the fibers at a molecular level. Anyway, if this vacuum can get glitter out of upholstery — trust me — dust doesn’t stand a chance, especially with a HEPA filter.\n–\nStephanie Zinn, editorial team\nPet hair removal tool (\nlink\n) –\nunder $50\nCleans carpets by picking up all the hair, dirt, debris you can’t get with just a vacuum. Great even if you don’t have a pet!\n–\nIsh Verduzco, marketing team\nLighting\nPhilips Hue Go Bluetooth table lamp (\nlink\n)\nI love this light because, in my home, it adds a touch of ambient uplighting to a corner nook. You control the brightness and color of the light and can power it on/off through the app on your phone. It can be used plugged in or unplugged, and it’s small enough to place on a side table. (I have it on the floor behind a chair with light projecting up.) It’s good for any room where you want a touch of extra light! It’s very cool!!\n–\nJuliet Grier, operations team\nPhilips Hue Smart Light starter kit (\nlink\n)\nI’ve been using these for years. I have them set to automatically turn on 5 mins before my alarm goes off in the morning and set to start dimming 30 mins before going to sleep at night.\n–\nIsh Verduzco, marketing team\nReading\nGritin rechargeable book light (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nMy biggest barrier to getting off my phone has been that I can’t read in the dark. I’ve had this light for almost a year and have only charged it twice, despite using it most nights. It has three light modes: warm, cool, and something in the middle (plus three brightness settings). Though my one gripe is that the cool setting is really only for folks with very eccentric tastes in lighting. It makes up for it by moonlighting as a bookmark, so there is absolutely no excuse to dog ear pages.\n–\nStephanie Zinn, editorial team\nJuniper Books book jackets (\nlink\n)\nGorgeous book jackets to dress up your bookshelves. A great gift for readers.\n–\nBrittney Burrows, events team\nKitchen\nCoffee and tea\nAerolatte original steam free milk frother (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nI use this milk frother to mix my creatine and protein powder into a 3:2:1 milk water coldbrew mixture in a pint glass. My wife makes matcha. Occasionally I froth milk to accompany cookies because it’s fun.\nThe aerolatte whisks well, although the main point is that an electric whisk is really useful and way, way better than a fork or a protein shaker.\n–\nSam Broner, deal team\nJura coffee maker (\nlink\n)\nI love this little coffee machine because it has a very small counter footprint for space-challenged kitchens, but it makes the best fresh ground for each cup of coffee or espresso. Better than Nespresso imo. With quality beans, better than coffee shops.\n–\nMichele Korver, regulatory team\nMem Tea monthly subscription box (\nlink\n)\nSomerville, Mass.’s local tea shop is the real deal. They sell mostly loose leaf, and ship anywhere in the U.S. I particularly recommend the Russian Caravan, Duchess Grey, and Red Zen.\n–\nScott Duke Kominers, research team\nNinja Luxe espresso machine (\nlink\n)\nMakes me feel real classy. I’m finally drinking real coffee from whole beans.\n–\nAaron Schnider, operations team\nTerra Kaffe TK-02 espresso machine (\nlink\n)\nA game-changer for coffee lovers. It delivers barista-level espresso at the touch of a button with customizable settings for every caffeine mood. Sleek, sustainable, and easy to clean. Perfect for anyone who craves café-quality brews without leaving home.\n–\nChris Lyons, deal team\nCooking and appliances\nFrom Our Place Wonder Oven toaster and air-fryer (\nlink\n)\nThis is an amazing air fryer. Not only does it look so cute on your counter, but it’s a great size for any kitchen. I use it almost every night to cook vegetables and fish and it’s so easy for quick and healthy dinners.\n–\nEm Westerhold, operations team\nZwilling stainless steel pan (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nGreat pan at a great price! Food cooks well and doesn’t stick.\n–\nMax Kesten, events team\nOffice\nDesks\nBranch Duo Compact Standing Desk (\nlink\n)\nThis standing desk looks great, has nice build quality, and is just the right width (36”) so it’s easy to fit in tight places.\n–\nDaniel Reynaud, engineering team\nHumanscale footrocker (\nlink\n)\nI also love these footrockers — I have tried all of them! They are super handy and helpful under your desk if you’re not standing.\n–\nSonal Chokshi, editorial team\nGoplus 2 in 1 Under Desk Treadmill (\nlink\n)\nStable, not too noisy, easy to operate and fits perfectly between the legs of the standing desk. The folding arms do take up some space, so it’s possible to find a lighter and more compact walking treadmill.\n–\nDaniel Reynaud, engineering team\nLamicall adjustable laptop stand (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nHelps you maintain good posture, looks good, and folds flat.\n–\nDaniel Reynaud\n, engineering team\nNexstand portable laptop stand (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nA digital nomad’s best friend. This laptop stand is lightweight, foldable, and sturdy. It’s great for taking Zoom calls at more flattering angles (goodbye up-nostril, double chin view) and for setting up a more ergonomic workspace on the go (as much as I will miss my chiropractor). I’m a religious user, as patrons at various coffee shops I’ve turned into offices can attest. Hat tip to Vitalik Buterin: I first came across the item in his “\n40-liter backpack travel guide\n.\n”\n–\nRobert Hackett, editorial team\nSaiji adjustable tablet stand (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nThis phone/tablet stand is fantastic. Accept no substitutes!\n–\nScott Duke Kominers, research team\nVornado 460 (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nA compact 3-speed fan for a home office. When you walk on a treadmill, you’re generating heat but not getting the air flow you would get by walking outside, so a fan is important to avoid getting sweaty during long meetings (and you may also want to keep the treadmill engine cool to extend its lifetime).\n–\nDaniel Reynaud\n, engineering team\nHeadphones, mics, and webcams\nAirPods 4 (\nlink\n)\nThe noise canceling works great to mask the background noise from the treadmill and the fan (above), and they’re more comfortable for walking than over-ear headphones.\n–\nDaniel Reynaud\n, engineering team\nCorsair HS65 surround gaming headset (\nlink\n)\nThis has been an incredible headset option for our podcast guests. My audio editors rave about its sound quality and its surround sound options make it a very versatile option for gaming and recording.\n–\nAngel Gehr, editorial team\nFifine USB computer microphone (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nThis is SUCH a great, super affordable, plug-and-play mic. We send it out to external pod guests because it is such a solid choice. Incredible sound quality and reliability.\n–\nAngel Gehr, editorial team\nOpal Tadpole webcam (\nlink\n)\nA great webcam option for people looking to record clear video with little-to-no setup. It’s compact, plug-and-play, and easy-to-use.\n–\nAngel Gehr, editorial team\nShure MV7 Mic (\nlink\n)\nLove the quality and ease of use. Just plug directly into the laptop and you’re good to go (unlike a lot of other pro mics).\n–\nIsh Verduzco, marketing team\nKeyboards and mouses\nErgodox EZ keyboard (\nlink)\nMy favorite device is my Ergodox EZ keyboard. I code in neovim, so having an optimized keyboard setup is important to my workflow. My Ergodox is comfortable because of its ergonomic split design, supports multiple layers so I don’t need to contort my hands into uncomfortable key combinations, and allows me to bind my keys to have different behaviors when held versus tapped. This lets me code comfortably all day long.\n–\nNoah Citron, engineering team\nEvoluent Essentials Full Featured Compact Keyboard (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nThis is one of the most left-hand friendly keyboards I’ve ever found! Also, not just for lefties 😉\n–\nSonal Chokshi, editorial team\nLogitech MX Master 3S wireless performance mouse (\nlink\n)\nThis mouse has a feature that lets you Bluetooth-connect to three laptops max, so it’s easy to use one mouse across three computers.\n–\nMichael Blau, deal team\nProductivity\nGrammarly grammar checker (\nlink\n)\n–\nunder $50\nThe best piece of advice I ever got is that no matter your level, your writing can always be better. Grammarly is an incredible tool for ensuring my writing is concise and clear — I even ran this blurb through it!\n–\nPaul Cafiero, communications team\nFocus Timer adjustable hourglass (\nlink\n)\nAn elegant and adjustable hourglass without the sand — perfect for segmenting project blocks, writing sessions, or even morning meditation.\n–\nScott Duke Kominers, research team\nToroflux\n(link\n)\n–\nunder $50\nA great fidget toy for your desk or while watching TV.\n–\nMichael Blau, deal team\nTravel\nPacking\nBagail packing cubes (\nlink\n) —\nunder $50\nPacking cubes will change your travel game. You won’t go back. No more cluttered suitcases!\n–\nMax Kesten, events team\nMesh travel bags (\nlink\n)\n—\nunder $50\nI use these mesh bags when I travel because they are so light and flexible… I hate rigid bags.\n–\nHelen Stoddard, events team\nRides\nRide1Up Revv1 moped-style ebike (\nlink\n)\nMy favorite purchase ever. I love that this bike is as fast as a moped and looks like a motorcycle, but it’s way more convenient than either, especially in the city. I also kitted mine with modifications like cafe racer handlebars, passenger footpegs, and an extra battery for increased distance.\n–\nMason Hall, deal team\n1999 Mitsubishi Delica JB 470 van from Japan (\nlink\n)\nGiven my profession, I spend an unhealthy amount of time online and have recently gotten into overlanding (basically off-roading, camping, and getting off the grid) as an attempt to offset some of the screen time. I looked at getting a regular RV here in the states but felt they were too big, bulky, and not very well designed (lots of wasted space). Sprinter vans were the alternative solution since they are much more compact, but with Van Life trending, they were around $50k-100k+ for a used one. So I fell down the YouTube rabbit hole one day and learned about these right hand drive mini campervans from Japan and fell in love with them. The size, design, practicality, functionality, and overall uniqueness all amazed me. The goal is to use this thing to explore national parks and spontaneous road trips. I really think life design is underrated. We spend so much of our time working and chasing the next accolade, I think we should be diverting some of that time and energy into actually enjoying life with loved ones. More time on hobbies, adventures, and whatever you find interesting. Excited to get this thing on the road and start making more memories.\n–\nIsh Verduzco, marketing team\n***\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

        "content": "Snowman is the consensus protocol implemented by the Avalanche blockchain and is part of the Snow family of protocols, first introduced through the original Avalanche leaderless consensus protocol. A major advantage of Snowman is that each consensus decision only requires an expected constant communication overhead per processor in the common case that the protocol is not under substantial Byzantine attack — it provides a solution to the scalability problem which ensures that the expected communication overhead per processor is independent of the total number of processors during normal operation.\nAndrew Lewis-Pye (LSE) discusses recent work with Ava Labs that addresses two issues with the Snowman consensus protocol. He considers a Byzantine adversary that controls substantial processors. First, he provides a simple proof of consistency for Snowman. Then he supplements Snowman with a liveness module that can be triggered in the case that a substantial adversary launches a liveness attack, and which guarantees liveness in this event by temporarily forgoing the communication complexity advantages of Snowman, but without sacrificing these low communication complexity advantages during normal operation.\nAbout the presenter\nAndrew is a mathematician and computer scientist and is a professor at the London School of Economics.

        "title": "Getting the bugs out of SNARKs: The road ahead",
        "url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/getting-bugs-out-of-snarks/",
        "content": "In the blockchain world, SNARKs hold the promise of unparalleled scalability and enhanced privacy compared to today’s transparent ledgers. Yet the current reality is that SNARK implementations are riddled with bugs, providing security through obscurity rather than robust cryptographic guarantees. Achieving true security requires formal verification — proof that SNARK systems are bug-free. This post briefly reviews progress on Jolt, our zkVM for RISC-V, and then discusses our efforts toward formal verification.\nzkVMs and Jolt: A short recap\nzkVMs are\nSNARKs\nthat allow an untrusted prover to prove that it correctly ran some specified computer program on a witness, where the program is specified as\nbytecode\nconforming to a particular instruction set architecture (ISA) like RISC-V.\nzkVMs offer the most promising path to usable and maintainable SNARKs. They allow developers to write programs in whatever high-level language they please, so long as the language comes with a compiler down to the ISA’s bytecode. Developers need not express computations directly as circuits or constraints, or even within “zkDSLs.” Those building the zkVMs will deal with the nastiness of constraint systems and circuits once and for all, meaning that anyone can then\nuse\nthe zkVM without any knowledge of how the proof machinery actually works.\nIn April 2024, we\nreleased\nan initial implementation of the Jolt zkVM for RISC-V and showed its performance compares favorably to alternatives. Our initial findings have since been confirmed by several\nother\nbenchmarks\n. Since then,\nwe have\ndramatically reduced\nJolt’s proof size (from several MBs to 200 KBs, and as low as 35 KBs at the cost of slightly increased prover time) and incorporated additional features like support for the Rust standard library and the RISC-V\nMultiplication extension\n.\nSoon, I expect Jolt to be the\nonly\nRISC-V zkVM capable of proving in resource-constrained environments (\nunder 2GB\nof prover space, compared to 8-16 GBs for RISC Zero and more for SP1), while\nalso\nachieving state-of-the art prover time.\nBut this post is not about Jolt’s performance or feature support. It’s about a more important topic:\ncorrectness\nand security.\nThis post lays out our roadmap toward the long-term goal of obtaining a\nformally verified Jolt implementation\nand describes the initial steps we have already taken along this path.\nA key risk for SNARKs\nBugs and catastrophes\nThe slightest bug in a SNARK toolchain can lead to catastrophic security failures. For example, a single missing or improperly specified constraint could mean that the prover does not actually know the witness that it claims it knows (e.g., does not actually know the secret key controlling the Ethereum wallet initiating a purported blockchain transaction).\nUntil we have confidence that our toolchains are completely bug free, projects using SNARKs cannot\nreally\nbe secured by the SNARK itself. At best, they are secured by obscurity: finding the bugs may require expertise (to identify missing or malspecified constraints, or any other bug in the tool-chain used to deploy the SNARK). But the bugs are there — and that likely means a motivated adversary can find convincing proofs of false statements.\nThe very worst-case situation is that we\nthink\nour SNARK toolchains are bug-free, and therefore stop treating SNARKs as but one of many layers of a system of defense-in-depth. These other layers of security will be semi-centralized. In the context of rollups, this may mean using an allowlist of who can submit proofs, the\nuse\nof\nTEEs\n, or a security council that can “undo” acceptance of buggy proofs, likely at the substantial cost and chaos of also “undoing” many transactions that network participants believed to have been already confirmed.\nThe long-term prospects are bright, but far off\nOver the long term, zkVMs will have implications not just for SNARK usability, but also for correctness. If we develop confidence that the zkVM itself is bug free,\nand\nensure that the program bytecode on which the zkVM is applied correctly implements the intended witness-checking procedure, then the end-to-end toolchain will also be bug free.\nThe Ethereum Foundation is\ninvesting heavily\nto bring this endgame to reality — but it is\nyears\naway. In fact, I consider it a distinct possibility that in five years’ time, we still don’t have strong confidence that any performative zkVM toolchain is actually bug free.\nToday, zkVM toolchains are almost certainly full of bugs.\nWe should stop pretending they’re not. To give a sense of how complicated they are, consider the following:\nThe Jolt codebase is up to\n34,000 lines of Rust code\n(if you don’t count the SDK or the RISC-V emulator, it’s “only” about 25,000 lines), plus it uses some functionality from\narkworks\n, namely\nfield\n,\ngroup\n, and\npairing\noperations\n. SP1 is over 60,000 lines of Rust\ncode\n(closer to 100,000 if you include the proof system it invokes,\nplonky3\n), plus thousands of lines of Go code, and several hundred lines of assembly code. RISC Zero’s codebase is even bigger, with over\n100,000 lines of Rust code\n, almost 200,000 lines of C++, 150,000 lines of CUDA, 400 lines of assembly, and more. (All of these statistics were obtained using the\ncloc –vcs git\ncommand to count lines of code.)\nOf course, most of these lines of code are devoted to implementing the zkVM prover, yet for security guarantees only the zkVM\nverifier\nneeds to be correctly implemented, and the verifier can be much simpler than the prover. Still, these statistics give a sense of the complexity of these systems, and even the verifier implementations are many thousands of lines of code.\nGiven this state of affairs, simplicity is a major virtue in any zkVM, and we firmly believe that Jolt is the\nsimplest zkVM\nfor RISC-V today. But formal methods are not some magic wand that can be waved at any piece of software and magically make all the bugs go away. Major technical challenges will have to be overcome to get any kind of guarantee that zkVM toolchains are end-to-end correct and secure. Simplicity in zkVMs is not only important in the short term; it will ease these formal verification efforts and remain a virtue for many years to come.\nRoadmap to a bug-free Jolt\nNear-term efforts (complete and in-progress)\nIn the intermediate term, there is no substitute for audits and bug-finding efforts. Jolt has not yet undergone a full audit, but it has been subjected to considerable scrutiny. Recently, the\nzkSecurity\nteam found several bugs in Jolt. These bugs were not in the “guts” of the proof machinery but rather in how inputs and outputs are processed, how Jolt makes sure the prover actually ran the computer program to completion rather than “stopping it early,” and in allowing the prover to specify certain parameters that should instead be specified by the verifier or another honest party. (See zkSecurity’s\ncompanion post\nfor additional details on the bugs and how they found them.)\nBeyond bug-finding efforts, we have taken the first steps along the (very) long road to a formally verified Jolt implementation. First, one major reason for Jolt’s simplicity is its lookup-centric design: Rather than expressing each primitive instruction of the VM as a circuit or constraint system, Jolt instead “decomposes” each instruction into a handful of lookups into small lookup tables and then uses our\nLasso lookup argument\nto verifiably perform the lookups. With\nCarl Kwan\nand\nQuang Dao\n, who are leading Jolt’s formal verification efforts, we have used the\nACL2 automated theorem prover\nto\nverify the correctness\nof Jolt’s lookup decompositions. This formalization is highly automated, which means the techniques will be easy to extend to different, richer ISAs than RISC-V, should the community prove interested in them down the line. These verification efforts have also led to modest performance improvements to Jolt, by identifying, in an automated fashion, some unnecessary lookups we were doing for a handful of primitive RISC-V instructions.\nSecond, Quang and collaborators\nGregor Mitscha-Baude\nfrom zkSecurity and\nDevon Tuma\nare using Lean to verify the soundness of the\nSpartan\n,\nLasso\n, and\nSpice\npolynomial IOPs\n(PIOPs) at the heart of Jolt. This work will extend broadly to all PIOPs used in practice, not only those used in Jolt. This work will likely be complete by the middle of 2025. As with all of Jolt, it’s being done in the open, and you can follow along with Quang’s progress at his\nZKlib repo\n. This effort is one of the projects recently funded by the Ethereum Foundation’s\nformal verification project\n.\nA third step is to verify (assuming the soundness of the polynomial IOPs above) that the constraint system to which Spartan is applied in Jolt, combined with the lookups and reads/writes to memory that Jolt applies Lasso and Spice to, together capture the RISC-V ISA. This effort consists of first building a formal RISC-V model in ACL2 (which is done), and then using ACL2 to verify the equivalence of the model to Jolt’s combination of constraints, lookups, and memory operations (which is in progress).\nLonger-term efforts\nConverging on a theorem prover\nWe plan to port over all of our ACL2 formalizations to Lean. Lean is newer and less mature than ACL2 but has more community support/libraries for mathematics, and more momentum within the SNARK community (e.g., a large part of the Ethereum Foundations’s\nzkEVM verification effort\nis expected to be in Lean). Most of our initial efforts have used ACL2 in large part to take advantage of its extensive support of\nautomated techniques like bit-blasting\n(e.g., bitvector reasoning via passing to a SAT solver) and rewriting. Lean recently\nadded support\nfor rudimentary bit-blasting, so long-term it may make sense to shift the entire effort to Lean.\nVerifying the actual Jolt implementation\nA major long-term challenge is to actually verify the Rust implementation of the Jolt verifier (much less an on-chain implementation of the same, via Solidity or EVM bytecode). We haven’t really begun to make headway here. Jolt is really just a polynomial IOP for proving correct execution of RISC-V programs, and our efforts to date have mainly focused on making sure the polynomial IOP is secure,\nnot\nthat the Rust implementation of Jolt correctly implements the polynomial IOP. The main exception to date: We have, via fuzzing, validated that the lookup decompositions we’ve formalized in ACL2 match the decompositions implemented in Jolt’s Rust codebase.\nHere, we will need good tooling to ensure the correctness of Rust code (according to certain specifications). There are many potential approaches for enabling this including tools such as\nRestricted Algorithmic Rust (RAR)\n,\nAeneas\n,\nVerus\n,\nand\nothers\n. Another possible approach is to circumvent the issue of Rust programming altogether. Many theorem provers (e.g., ACL2, Lean, Coq) support code extraction to certain target languages (e.g., OCaml, C, Lisp), and Rust may be supported in the future. A major issue with code extraction is that often the “cross-compilation” step is itself unverified. One unique advantage of ACL2 is that execution in the theorem prover is the same as native Common Lisp execution, so a “formally-verified Jolt verifier” in ACL2 can be called as needed, requiring no cross-compilation to a target language. Overall, I would not be surprised if we only seriously target this essential direction 1.5 years or more from now. A silver lining of this timeline is that Rust tooling will mature considerably in the meantime.\nIn the meantime, as we verify the correctness of various components of Jolt’s polynomial IOP and constraint systems using Lean/ACL2, we’ll\nextensively test for compliance of the verified models with Jolt’s Rust code. This is the approach that we took in\nverifying Jolt’s lookup decompositions.\nThough it falls well short of the end goal of a “formally verified Rust verifier,” it does\nlet us\ngain confidence in the correctness of different parts of the Jolt codebase.\nA DSL for all “constraints” used in Jolt\nUnlike other zkVMs, which mainly use so-called Plonkish or AIR constraint systems to capture VM execution, Jolt uses a combination of rank-one constraints (R1CS) and “offline memory checking” techniques via Lasso and Spice that check that the prover is correctly performing reads into read-only memory (aka lookups) and read-write memory (aka registers and RAM), respectively.\nCurrently, the Jolt implementation specifies the above constraints/lookups/memory operations in ad hoc fashion. For R1CS specification, we were initially using Circom, but due to untenable overheads, we hand-rolled our own R1CS specification language and\nvertically integrated it into Jolt\n. Likewise, lookups and reads and writes of registers and RAM are specified via internal APIs.\nFor maintainability and continued verification as Jolt evolves, it would be good to have a single DSL that cleanly captures R1CS, lookups, and registers/RAM. This will also be useful for pre-compile specification. (Like Jolt itself, pre-compiles in Jolt will consist of a mix of R1CS, lookups, and arithmetic circuits to which the\nGKR\nprotocol\ncan be applied.) We are working with Galois to take steps in this direction.\nFormal verification and controlling prover memory\nA challenge for formal verification efforts is the heavy use of SNARK recursion in today’s zkVMs. To keep the prover’s space bounded (i.e., avoid needing terabytes of space to prove even toy program executions) and to reduce proof size, the standard procedure today is to break VM executions into “shards,” prove correct execution of each shard, and then recursively aggregate the proofs. This requires turning a SNARK verifier into a circuit or constraint system, and proving that one knows a satisfying assignment for the circuit. Any error in the specification of the circuit can lead to catastrophic security failures. And from a usability perspective, recursion simply makes it very hard for the public to tell what statement is actually being verified. No longer is the prover simply proving, “I ran this computer program correctly.” Rather, it is proving, “I know\nmany proofs,\none per shard\n,\nthat each shard was run correctly, and the state of the machine at the end of shard\ni\nmatches the state at the start of shard\ni\n+1”.\nAt least for sum-check-based SNARKs like Jolt, it is actually known how to keep the prover’s space bounded\nwithout\nSNARK recursion\n. We’ll flesh out the details in the context of Jolt in an upcoming e-print, and have begun implementing such a non-recursive space-bounded prover. It will take major engineering effort to achieve a performant implementation with this approach, but this will eventually pay off, leading to a simpler and easier-to-verify implementation.\nFolding\nLong term, I expect that “non-recursive space control” for SNARK provers will be an effective way to achieve a simple and performative prover when using hashing-based commitment schemes like\nLigero, Brakedown, or FRI-Binius\n. But for the elliptic-curve-based commitment schemes supported by Jolt today,\nfolding\nis the right way to minimize prover space while keeping the prover fast. Since folding inherently involves recursion, this will require formally verifying the correctness of a circuit representation of the Jolt verifier. This task may be complicated but will be helped by new tooling from the zkEVM formal verification project.\n(\nI don’t expect that folding will be difficult to incorporate into Jolt, but it might be challenging to apply formal methods to confirm its correctness due to its application of recursive proving to a complicated verification procedure. Fortunately, lots of tools are being developed to help with this task.)\nVerifying commitment schemes and Fiat-Shamir\nSuccinct arguments typically consist of two components: a PIOP and a polynomial commitment scheme. Together, this yields a succinct\ninteractive\nargument, which is then rendered non-interactive via the\nFiat-Shamir transformation\n. Efforts described above to formally verify the soundness of the Jolt PIOP are not enough on their own to guarantee that the Jolt SNARK is secure. We will also have to verify that the polynomial commitment schemes supported by Jolt are secure and correctly implemented, and also formally verify that applying Fiat-Shamir to the resulting succinct argument is secure and correctly implemented. This is a future goal of Quang and his collaborators’ work in\nZklib\n, that is, to verify the soundness not only of PIOPs but also of polynomial commitment schemes and the PIOP-to-SNARK transformation.\nOther Directions\nVerified bytecode\nSome projects have criticized RISC-V zkVMs by discussing bugs in compilers from high-level languages down to RISC-V bytecode, and leveling criticisms at Rust as a high-level language. Our take is if one wants verified RISC-V bytecode then one should verify the bytecode directly, or use a verified compiler. And if one doesn’t like Rust as a high-level language, then one is free to use any other high-level language that compiles down to RISC-V.\nTo be sure, additional tooling to produce verified RISC-V bytecode would be of massive value to zkVMs. But that is outside of the scope of the zkVM itself. The zkVM’s job is to make sure the bytecode it is handed is run correctly.\nA verified implementation of the EVM via Jolt with precompiles\nRISC-V zkVMs are a promising tool for building zkEVMs (EVM=Ethereum Virtual Machine). Jolt is well suited for this task, but for maximum performance this will entail incorporating a handful of pre-compiles into Jolt (and formally verifying the implementation indeed captures EVM semantics). This is on the Jolt roadmap, and the formal verification component will be able to take advantage of other efforts supported by EF’s zkEVM Formal Verification project.\n***\nI have serious concerns about the rush to deploy zkVMs while they still almost certainly contain bugs. The road to bug-free zkVMs is long, and extreme caution is warranted while we walk it. But we will get there eventually, and the tools and techniques developed along the way will pay rich dividends in computer science and mathematics well beyond SNARK design.\n***\nJustin Thaler\nis Research Partner at a16z and an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University.

In this edition, we share thoughts on how the regulatory environment may change post-election; suggestions for U.S. agencies to seize the opportunity; and insights into stablecoins and Ethereum’s future.\nThe path forward, post-election\nMiles Jennings, Michele Korver, and Brian Quintenz\nIn the wake of this election, you’re probably hearing lots of speculation about what will happen to crypto from a regulatory perspective. Most of these takes — and the many yet to come, no doubt — will just be noise.\nThe truth is that it’s too early to tell how everything will shake out. What we do know is that the months ahead will mark a significant shift for the industry and the people working in it.\nWe’re optimistic that the U.S. will now be a better place for crypto builders, and that startups here won’t have to be so focused on merely surviving a hostile regulatory environment. Instead, they can keep working toward all of the exciting progress crypto can make when allowed to thrive with bipartisan support, such as:\ngiving people ownership over their digital identities,\nnew business models for creators,\nlow to no-fee cross-border transactions with stablecoins,\nnew ways for small businesses to engage with their customers,\ndecentralized social networks that empower users,\ndevelopment of physical infrastructure like energy grids,\nblockchains that democratize AI and games,\n…and so much more that we can’t even imagine yet. The future of crypto in the U.S. is bright — it’s the perfect time to build here, and we’re excited about the possibility of regulatory clarity to come.\nRead more\nplus\n: here are a16z cofounders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz on the election’s implications for tech generally and also for crypto in the\nlatest episode\nof their podcast.\n7 things U.S. agencies could do to seize the crypto opportunity\nBrian Quintenz\nImagine if Department of Transportation officials were prohibited from ever getting into a car or riding an airplane. That’s what is happening with the government employees who are tasked with regulating crypto: Right now they’re restricted from using any amount of it, according to a 2022\nlegal advisory notice\nfrom the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.\nWhile it’s obviously important to maintain ethical standards around conflicts of interest, sensible policy comes from engagement with the technology and the knowledge that provides. Government employees charged with regulating crypto should be allowed to use it.\nThis is just one of seven proposals that Brian Quintenz, our head of global policy, recommends government agencies take to help create a functioning regulatory regime for crypto that incentivizes decentralization while protecting consumers. Others include ways to increase efficiency, competition, innovation, and more.\nRead more\nTrend-tracking: Stablecoins\nSam Broner\nMillions of people have transacted trillions of dollars using stablecoins, and yet definitions of the category, and therefore people’s understanding of it, are still fuzzy. To understand the richness and limitations of the stablecoin design space, one useful lens is the history of banking: what worked, what didn’t, and why.\nStablecoins offer users many familiar experiences from bank deposits and bank notes — convenient and reliable store of value, medium of exchange, lending — but in an unbundled, “self-custodiable” form. Like many products in crypto, stablecoins will likely speedrun banking history, starting with simple banknotes before expanding the money supply through increasingly sophisticated lending.\nHere, the author looks at three types of stablecoin tokens, along with their fiat predecessors in the tradfi banking stack, to evaluate how stablecoin adoption could play out.\nRead more\nA deal-maker’s view\nJane Lippencott\nOnchain commerce has been a dominant narrative of 2024, with stablecoin volume ($8.5 trillion in Q2 2024) and market cap (nearly $180 billion today) demonstrating that the need for cheaper, faster, and more transparent payments is a cycle-resistant phenomenon.\na16z crypto State of Crypto Report\n, p.34\nUnderpinning this momentum, 2024 has brought real, institutional-level change. Stripe, SWIFT, and Visa have launched initiatives to use stablecoins natively, greenlighting banks all over the world to partner with crypto wallet providers and start accepting stablecoins on their customers’ behalf. Global regulatory bodies are discussing legislation aimed to clarify rules for onchain payments infrastructure, acknowledging the strategic influence that the first few countries to codify clear guidelines will gain in the ever-changing global financial system.\nThe sheer size of Stripe’s intended acquisition of Bridge — a B2B startup building APIs for stablecoin orchestration — encapsulates the seriousness that global fintechs and banks should be bringing to their boardrooms. When we meet with multinational corporations who are thinking about ways they can meaningfully leverage crypto and web3, the opportunities stablecoins present are consistently at the forefront.\nMore takes on stablecoins…\n💵\nWhat we still don’t know about stablecoins\nStablecoins promise to change the balance of power in long-established industries. Two recent articles from Lightspark Cofounder\nChristian Catalini\n(one with\nJane Wu\n) explore the realities of the stablecoin market. In particular, stablecoin network effects could be weaker than most people anticipate, and competition in the market is far from winner-take-all. While industry insiders often cite liquidity as the primary reason only a few stablecoins will dominate, the truth is more complex. (\nForbes\n/\nHarvard Business Review\n, with Jane Wu)\n🇺🇸\nHow stablecoins can strengthen the U.S. dollar\nStablecoins are typically denominated in dollars and backed by dollar-denominated securities, which is leading crypto in some dollar-friendly directions, writes economist\nTyler Cowen\n. And, as revealed in our\n2024 State of Crypto Report\n, stablecoins have already found product-market fit, as a nearly free, nearly instant payments platform. All of this can concentrate interest in the U.S. dollar and bolster its status as the dominant global currency. (\nBloomberg\n)\nInside Devcon: Glimpsing (possible) Ethereum futures\nNoah Citron\nAt Devcon this past Tuesday,\nJustin Drake\nof the Ethereum Foundation\nrevealed his vision\nfor Ethereum’s future: the “beam” chain. Beam would be an overhaul of Ethereum’s consensus layer, inspired by lessons from building the beacon chain, the backbone of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system.\nBeam would be designed to improve staking economics, increase decentralization, add single slot finality, reduce block times, migrate to post-quantum cryptography, and use zkVMs to make validators more performant. Work on beam would continue alongside the existing beacon chain, with the goal of switching to beam around 2029.\nBeam also represents an opportunity to onboard additional core development teams, Drake said, announcing plans to build beam clients both in Asia and South America. Drake emphasized that this is just his vision for Ethereum, but he hopes to gain alignment within the Ethereum community over the coming months.\nWatch the talk\n…\nrawr\n—\na16z crypto editorial, research, and engineering teams\n***\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

        "title": "A useful framework for understanding stablecoins: Banking history",
        "url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/understanding-stablecoins-banking-history/",
        "content": "Millions of people have transacted trillions of dollars using stablecoins — and yet definitions of the category, and therefore people’s understanding of it, remain fuzzy.\nStablecoins are stores of value and media of exchange, usually — but not necessarily — pegged to the dollar. They have been described as existing on two axes: from under- to over-collateralized, and from centralized to decentralized. This is useful, especially in helping people understand how technical structure\nrelates to risk\nand in combating misconceptions about stablecoins. I’ll build on that framework by offering another instructive way to think about them.\nIf we want to understand the richness — and limitations — of the stablecoin design space, one useful lens is the history of banking: what worked, what didn’t, and why. Like many products in crypto, stablecoins will likely speedrun banking history, starting with simple banknotes before expanding the money supply through increasingly sophisticated lending.\nFirst, I’ll consider the recent history of stablecoins, then take you through some banking history to be able to draw out useful comparisons between stablecoins and the banking stack. Stablecoins offer users many familiar experiences from bank deposits and bank notes — convenient and reliable store of value, medium of exchange, lending — but in an unbundled, “self-custodiable” form factor. Along the way, I’ll evaluate three kinds of tokens: fiat-backed stablecoins, asset-backed stablecoins, and strategy-backed synthetic dollars.\nLet’s dive in.\nSome recent stablecoin history\nThe years since\nUSDC\n— the most widely adopted US-based stablecoin — launched in 2018 have produced enough evidence to show what has and hasn’t worked, so it’s time to clearly delineate the landscape. Early adopters use fiat-backed stablecoins to transfer and save money. Decentralized-overcollateralized lending protocols produce stablecoins that are useful and reliable, but have seen flat demand. Consumers so far seem to strongly prefer dollar-denominated stablecoins over other (fiat or novel) denominations.\nSome categories of stablecoins have outright failed. Decentralized-undercollateralized stablecoins are more capital efficient than fiat-backed or overcollateralized stablecoins, but the highest profile examples have ended in catastrophe. Others categories have yet to materialize: Yield-bearing stablecoins are intuitively exciting — who doesn’t like yield? — but face user experience and regulatory hurdles.\nOther kinds of dollar-denominated tokens have also emerged, piggybacking on the successful\nproduct-market fit\nof stablecoins.\nStrategy-backed synthetic dollars\n(described in more detail below) are a new product category that has not yet been properly described, similar to stablecoins but not actually meeting important standards for safety and maturity, with riskier yield adopted as investments by DeFi enthusiasts.\nWe’ve also witnessed the rapid adoption of\nfiat-backed stablecoins\n, attractive because of their simplicity and perceived safety; the lagging adoption of\nasset-backed stablecoins\n, traditionally the largest share of deposit investments. Analyzing stablecoins through the lens of the traditional banking stack helps explain these trends.\nBank deposits and American money: A little history\nTo understand how contemporary stablecoins mimic the banking stack, it’s useful to understand the history of banking in the United States. Before the Federal Reserve Act (1913) and especially before the National Banking Acts (1863 –1864), different types of dollars were not treated equally. (For those interested in\nlearning more\n, the United States had three central banking eras prior to a national currency: The Central Banking Eras [First Bank 1791–1811 and Second Bank 1816–1836], the Free Banking Era [1837–1863], and the National Banking Era [1863–1913]. We’ve tried everything.)\nPrior to establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933, deposits had to be specifically underwritten against banking risk. Bank notes (cash), deposits, and checks could have very different “real” values depending on three factors: who issued them, the ease of redemption, and the perceived reliability of the issuer.\nWhy? Because of a tension banks faced (and still face) between making money and keeping deposits safe.\nTo make money, banks need to invest deposits and take on risk, but to keep deposits safe banks need to manage risk and have cash on hand. Before the mid-to-late 1800s, people judged different forms of money as having different levels of risk — and hence different real values. After the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, a dollar became a dollar (for the most part).\nToday, banks use dollar deposits to buy treasuries and equities, make loans, and participate in simple strategies like market making or hedging as permitted by the Volcker Rule, which was introduced in 2008 to reduce insolvency risk by decreasing speculation at retail banks. Lending is a particularly important part of banking and is how banks increase money supply and capital efficiency in the economy.\nWhile retail banking customers might think of all of their money sitting in their deposit accounts, this is not the case. Yet because of federal oversight, consumer protections, broad adoption, and improved risk management, consumers can treat deposits as a unified balance that is relatively risk free. Banks are balancing money-making and risk in the background, while users are mostly ignorant of exactly what banks are doing with their deposits, but largely assured of\ndeposit safety\neven during instability.\nStablecoins offer users many familiar experiences from bank deposits and bank notes — convenient and reliable store of value, medium of exchange, lending — but in an unbundled, “self-custodiable” form factor. Stablecoins will follow their fiat predecessors. Adoption will start with simple banknotes, but as decentralized lending protocols mature, asset backed stablecoins will grow in popularity.\nStablecoins through the lens of bank deposits\nWith that background, we can evaluate the three types of stablecoins — fiat-backed stablecoins, asset-backed stablecoins, and strategy-backed synthetic dollars — through the lens of retail banking.\nFiat-backed stablecoins\nFiat-backed stablecoins\nare similar to U.S. bank notes from the National Banking Era (1865–1913). In this period, bank notes were\nbearer instruments\nissued by banks; federal regulation required customers could redeem them for equivalent\ngreenbacks\n(e.g., special U.S. Treasuries) or other legal tender (“\nspecie\n”). So while the value of the bank notes could vary depending on the issuer’s reputation, proximity, and perceived solvency, most people trusted bank notes.\nFiat-backed stablecoins operate under the same principle. They are tokens that users can directly redeem for a well-understood, trusted fiat currency — with a similar caveat: While banknotes were a bearer instrument that anyone could redeem, the holder might not live close to the issuing bank. Over time, people accepted that they could find someone to trade with who could then redeem their banknote for a greenback or specie. Similarly, fiat-backed stablecoin users have grown confident that they can use Uniswap, Coinbase, or other exchanges to reliably find someone who values high quality fiat-backed stablecoins at a dollar.\nToday, a combination of regulatory pressure and user preference seems to be drawing more and more users toward fiat-backed stablecoins, which constitute over 94% of the total stablecoin supply. Two companies, Circle and Tether, dominate fiat-backed stablecoins issuance, together issuing over $150B in dollar-dominated fiat-backed stablecoins.\nBut why should users trust fiat-backed stablecoins issuers? After all, fiat-backed stablecoins are centrally issued, and it’s easy to imagine a “bank run” of stablecoin redemptions. To counter these risks, fiat-backed stablecoins benefit from being audited by reputable accounting firms. For instance, Circle undergoes regular audits from Deloitte. These audits are designed to ensure that stablecoin issuers have enough fiat currency or short-term treasuries in reserve to cover any near-term redemptions and that the issuer has enough total fiat collateral to support back every stablecoin 1:1.\nVerifiable proof of reserve and decentralized issuance of fiat stablecoins or verifiable proof of reserves are both possible, but not yet implemented.\nVerifiable proof of reserve\nwould improve auditability and is possible today through\nzkTLS\n(zero knowledge transport layer security, also known as web proofs) and similar means, although it still relies on trusted centralized authority.\nDecentralized issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins\nmay be possible, but substantial regulatory issues stand in the way. For instance, to issue decentralized fiat-backed stablecoins, issuers would need to hold U.S. treasuries onchain with a similar risk profile to traditional treasuries. That isn’t possible today, but it would make it even easier for users to trust fiat backed stablecoins.\nAsset-backed stablecoins\nAsset-backed stablecoins\nare the product of onchain loans. They mimic how banks create new money through lending. Decentralized overcollateralized lending protocols like the Sky Protocol (formerly MakerDAO) issue new stablecoins that are backed by onchain, highly liquid collateral.\nTo understand how this works, consider a checking account. The money in your checking account is part of a complicated system of lending, regulation, and risk management that creates new money. In fact, the majority of the money in circulation,\nthe so-called M2 money supply\n, is created by banks through lending. While banks use mortgages, auto loans, business loans, inventory financing, and more to create money, lending protocols use onchain tokens as loan collateral thereby creating asset-backed stablecoins.\nThe system that enables loans to create new money is called\nfractional reserve banking\n, which started in earnest with the Federal Reserve Banking Act of 1913. Fractional reserve banking has matured significantly since then with major updates in 1933 (with the establishment of the FDIC), in 1971 (when President Nixon ended the gold standard), and in 2020 (when reserve requirement ratios were reduced to zero).\nWith each change consumers and regulators became more confident in the systems that create new money through lending. Over 110 years, lending has created a larger and larger portion, now a larger majority, of the U.S. money supply.\nThere’s a good reason consumers don’t consider all this lending every time they use a dollar. First, money stored in bank deposits is protected by federal deposit insurance. Second, despite major crises like those in 1929 and 2008, banks and regulators have steadily improved their practices and processes to reduce risk.\nTraditional financial institutions have used three methods to safely issue a loan:\nagainst an asset with liquid markets and quick liquidation practices (margin loans)\nusing large scale statistical analysis over a bundled set of loans (mortgages)\nwith thoughtful and bespoke underwriting (business loans)\nDecentralized lending protocols still only make up a small portion of the stablecoin supply because they are at the very beginning of this journey.\nThe most prominent decentralized overcollateralized lending protocols are transparent, well tested, and conservative. For example, Sky, the most prominent collateralized lending protocol, issues asset-backed stablecoins against assets that are: onchain, exogenous, low volatility, and highly liquid (easily sellable). Sky also has strict rules about collateralization ratios as well as effective governance and auction protocols. These properties make sure that even with changing conditions, collateral can be safely sold, protecting the redemption value of the asset-backed stablecoin.\nUsers can evaluate collateralized lending protocols against four criteria:\ntransparency of governance\nratio, quality, and volatility of assets backing the stablecoin\nsecurity of smart contracts\nability to maintain loan collateralization ratio in real time\nAs with the example of money in a checking account, asset-backed stablecoins are new money created through asset-backed loans, but with vastly more transparent, auditable, and understandable lending practices. Users can audit the collateral underlying asset-backed stablecoins, but can only trust bank executives’ investment decisions with their deposits.\nFurther, the decentralization and transparency that blockchains enable can mitigate the risks that securities laws are intended to address. This is important for stablecoins because it means that truly decentralized asset-backed stablecoins are potentially\noutside the scope of securities laws\n— an analysis that may be limited to asset-backed stablecoins that rely exclusively on digitally native collateral (as opposed to “real-world assets”). This is because such collateral can be safeguarded with autonomous protocols, as opposed to centralized intermediaries.\nAs more of the economy moves onchain, expect two things: first, for more assets to be candidates for the collateral used in lending protocols; and second, for asset-backed stablecoins to be a larger portion of onchain money. Other types of loans will likely eventually be safely issued onchain to further extend the onchain money supply. With that said, just because users can evaluate asset-backed stablecoins does not mean every user will want to take on that responsibility.\nJust as it has taken time for traditional bank lending to grow, regulators to lower reserve requirements, and lending practices to mature, it will take time for onchain lending protocols to mature. So it will be a while before more people can easily transact with asset-backed stablecoins as readily as we can transact with fiat-backed stablecoins.\nStrategy-backed synthetic dollars\nRecently, some projects have been offering $1-denominated tokens that represent a combination of collateral and an investment strategy. These tokens are often lumped in with stablecoins, but strategy-backed synthetic dollars should not be considered stablecoins. Here’s why.\nStrategy-backed synthetic dollars\n(SBSDs) expose users directly to actively managed trading risk. They are typically centralized, undercollateralized tokens layered with financial derivatives. More accurately, SBSDs are dollar shares in an open-ended hedge fund — a structure that is both difficult to audit and that could expose users to centralized exchange (CEX) risk and asset price volatility, if, for instance, there were significant market movements or a persistent downward sentiment.\nThese attributes make SBSDs a poor choice for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange, which are the main purpose of stablecoins. While SBSDs can be constructed in many ways, with varying levels of risk and stability, all of them offer a dollar-denominated financial product that people may want in their investment portfolios.\nSBSDs can be built on many strategies — for instance, the\nbasis trade\nor participation in  yield-generating protocols like the restaking protocols that help secure actively validated services (\nAVSs\n)\n. These projects manage risk and reward, typically allowing users to earn yield on top of a cash position. By managing risk with earnings, including by evaluating AVSs for slashing risk, seeking higher yield opportunities, or monitoring the basis trade for inversion, projects can produce a yield-bearing SBSD.\nUsers should deeply understand the risks and mechanisms of any SBSD before using it (as with any novel instrument). DeFi users should also consider the consequences of using SBSDs in DeFi strategies due to the substantial cascading consequences of a depeg. When an asset depegs, or suddenly loses value relative to its tracking asset, derivatives that rely on price stability and consistent yield can destabilize suddenly. But underwriting the risk of any given strategy can be hard or impossible when the strategy includes centralized, closed source, or unauditable components. You have to know what you’re underwriting to underwrite it.\nWhile banks do run simple strategies with bank deposits, they’re actively managed and a\nde minimis\npart of the overall capital allocation. It’s hard to use these strategies to back stablecoins because they must be actively managed, which makes those strategies hard to reliably decentralize or audit. SBSDs expose users to more concentrated risk than banks allow in deposits. Users would be right to be skeptical if their deposits were held in such a vehicle.\nIn fact, users have been wary of SBSDs. Despite their popularity among risk-favoring users, few users are transacting with them. Further, the U.S. SEC has brought\nenforcement\nactions\nagainst issuers of “stablecoins” that functioned like shares in investment funds.\n***\nStablecoins have arrived. There are over $160B of stablecoins used in transactions around the globe. They’ve settled into two major categories: fiat-backed stablecoins and asset-backed stablecoins. Other dollar-denominated tokens, like strategy-backed synthetic dollars, have grown in mindshare, but don’t fit the definition of a stablecoin as fit for transaction or storing value.\nBanking history is a great proxy for understanding the category — stablecoins must first consolidate around a clear, understandable, and trivially redeemable bank note, similar to how federal reserve banknotes won over mindshare in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Over time, we should expect asset-backed stablecoins, issued by decentralized overcollateralized lenders, to increase in volume, just as the M2 money supply has been increased by banks lending on deposits. And lastly, we should expect DeFi to continue to grow, both by creating more SBSDs for investors and by increasing the quality and quantity of asset-backed stablecoins.\nBut this analysis — as useful as it might be — only takes us so far. Stablecoins are already the cheapest way to send a dollar, meaning that real opportunities exist for stablecoins to reset the market structure in the payments industry, creating opportunities for incumbents and, even more importantly, for startups to build on a new platform of frictionless and cost-free payments.\n***\nAcknowledgements: Special thanks to Eddy Lazzarin, Tim Sullivan, Aiden Slavin, Robert Hackett, Michael Blau, Miles Jennings, and Scott Kominers for their thoughtful feedback and suggestions that made this post possible.\n***\nSam Broner\nis a partner on the investing team at a16z crypto.

        "content": "In April, the a16z crypto research and engineering teams released an initial implementation of\nJolt\n, a state-of-the-art zkVM. Since then, the Jolt team and open source contributors have made several improvements to Jolt’s performance and usability.\nThe upshot for performance is that Jolt’s verifier costs have come way down: from proof sizes that were well into the MBs in April, to about 200 KBs today. Further reductions down to 25 KBs are possible.\nJolt’s reduced verifier costs will pay further dividends in the coming months, unlocking efficient\nfolding\nschemes\nto control prover space. Integrating folding into Jolt will yield three major features all at once. Folding will\nkeep the prover’s space to just a few GB,\nachieve zero-knowledge, and\nyield on-chain proofs.\nSeparately, the Jolt prover is poised to speed up by roughly a factor of up to 3. This improvement will come from\nincorporating\nrecently-identified\noptimizations\nto the sum-check protocol, and\nbetter leveraging\nof the highly uniform nature of the constraint system arising in Jolt.\nA short video overview of the Jolt roadmap and vision is\nhere\n. Details of the improvements completed since April are below.\nRust standard library support\nOn release, Jolt only supported guest programs written in “no-std” Rust. Engineering partner\nNoah Citron\nintegrated support for the Rust standard library, enabling developers to use many more existing Rust crates off-the-shelf.\nRISC-V “M” extension\nWith help from open source contributors\nMihir Wadekar\nand\nEthan Lee\n, we added support for the RISC-V “M” extension for integer multiplication and division. This significantly improved Jolt’s performance on guest programs using many multiplications or divisions, which previously would be compiled to lengthy instruction sequences.\nSupport for new commitment schemes\nThe initial implementation of Jolt used Hyrax as its polynomial commitment scheme, though the Jolt architecture is compatible with any multilinear commitment scheme. While Hyrax provided good prover performance, its proofs were relatively large. Open source contributors\nPat Stiles\nand\nEthan Lee\nintegrated the\nZeromorph\nand\nHyperKZG\npolynomial commitment schemes, respectively, both of which significantly reduce proof sizes with only a modest prover slowdown.\nSmaller opening proofs\nWe implemented a sum-check-based protocol (originally implemented in\nNova\n) to reduce multiple opening proofs to one. This reduces proof size and, for some polynomial commitment schemes, reduces prover time as well.\n“Quarks” grand products\nOpen source contributor\nalpeh_v\nimplemented the grand product argument described in the Quarks\npaper\nas an alternative to Jolt’s existing implementation of\nThaler ‘13\ngrand products. Compared to Thaler ‘13, the Quarks grand product argument yields smaller proofs at the cost of prover time.\nProgress towards on-chain verification\nAlpeh_v\nand\nMatteo Mer\nalso made significant progress toward a Solidity implementation of the Jolt verifier. Once completed, this will allow Jolt proofs to be verified on any EVM blockchain.\nAVX-512 library for field arithmetic\nWe worked with Dag Arne Osvik to release an\nAVX-512 library\nfor 256-bit Montgomery arithmetic. This can be used to accelerate field arithmetic in Jolt, Groth16, and other elliptic curve-based SNARKs on hardware that supports the extension. A full integration of this library into Jolt will come in the future.\nOngoing formal verification efforts\nLed by Quang Dao and Carl Kwan, interns in our summer research program, formal verification efforts have taken on four tasks so far:\nBuilding and validating a formal model of RISC-V in ACL2\nVerifying that the “evaluation table decompositions” in Jolt are all correct (i.e., verifying the way we break each primitive instruction into lookups into “subtables” and collate the results into the instruction’s output)\nConfirming that the “R1CS constraints and lookups” in Jolt together in fact capture correct RISC-V semantics\nFormalizing in Lean the completeness and soundness of the Jolt polynomial IOP, starting with two of its key components: Lasso and Spartan\nThe first two tasks are complete, the third is nearly so, and the fourth is in progress. These efforts have already led to the identification of minor bugs and optimizations in the Jolt implementation.\nComing soon\nOur work is far from finished. We are working with several teams and individual contributors to advance Jolt, and we have several exciting improvements underway, including:\nVarious sum-check prover optimizations\nFurther reduction in proof size and verifier costs\nGPU integration\nContinuations via folding (i.e., integration of Jolt with Nova).\nIntegration of the Binius commitment scheme and a switch from 256-bit prime-order fields to binary fields are further out.\nIf you’d like to contribute or learn more about Jolt’s\nroadmap\n, reach out to\n@moodlezoup\n.\n***\nJustin Thaler\nis Research Partner at a16z and an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University.

        "url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/ethereum-roadmap-focil-and-multi-proposers/",
        "content": "Ethereum now supports a vibrant ecosystem of applications and Layer 2s. But its transaction supply chain, which determines which transactions land onchain, enshrines certain participants with market power, harming the chain’s economic efficiency.\nMany issues with Ethereum’s transaction supply chain stem from the fact that for every slot, a single proposer has monopoly control over what transactions to include in their block. Proposers also have incentives offchain and from the application layer that affect their behavior. These sometimes competing incentives make it difficult to encourage proposers to\nhonestly follow the protocol\n.\nTwo types of proposer deviations are of particular concern: (1) short-term censorship, and (2) acting on enshrined latency advantages.\nHow to prioritize and address these two problems depends on Ethereum’s development roadmap. If Ethereum has to solve short-term censorship resistance, constrained single proposer designs have appealing properties while also being close to well specified enough with proposals like\nFOCIL\nto be implemented. But if Ethereum’s success also relies on addressing some of the negative market effects of single proposer schemes on the application layer, more drastic change likely needs to happen.\nMulti-proposer schemes\nlook promising to address the broader concerns.\nThe rest of this post describes these problems in more detail before getting into how these issues impact Ethereum’s functionality. I’ll then analyze the two potential solutions to address them — the implementation of which depends on Ethereum’s roadmap.\nProblem 1: Short-term censorship\nBlockchains inherent censorship resistance from liveness: Eventually every valid submitted transaction will make it onchain. But the bounds on how long a transaction will take to be included onchain are too loose for many applications. DeFi transactions are a common example, where it might be only a few seconds until a transaction is stale. In these scenarios, a proposer could stand to gain by censoring a transaction even for a single block, degrading the efficiency of these applications.\nConsider the\ncase\nwhere a dapp wants to sell an item every slot via a first price auction. Assume this item has a common value of $10; thus in a competitive auction we’d expect the dapp to receive around $10. But since the auction takes place over the course of a slot, all the bids from the auction need to be included by the proposer. In a single proposer scheme, the proposer could simply exclude others’ bids, and include only their own low bid, winning the item for much less than the item is worth.\nSuch instances require a notion of\nshort-term censorship resistance\nthat captures how hard it is for an adversary to censor a transaction for a single block. Short-term censorship resistance is an economic property. If more transactions demand to be included in a block than there is space, some of the transactions must be left out. Those transactions aren’t necessarily being censored by an adversary; rather, they are simply priced out of inclusion. However, some protocols make it easier for an adversary to either price out or incentivize the proposer not to include target transactions. In the spirit of saying protocol A is\nmore\ncensorship resistant than protocol B if it is more difficult for an adversary to censor a target transaction in A than B, we use the following definition:\nProtocol A is more short-term censorship resistant than protocol B if all else equal, for any transaction t, the minimum net payments an adversary has to make to prevent t from being included at equilibrium in a given block is higher under A than B.\n(This definition is intentionally not well defined mathematically. Formally defining the game being played and the equilibrium concept will be the subject of future work. For now, the examples convey the spirit of this definition.)\nExample\nWith Ethereum using\nEIP-1559\nas its fee mechanism, an adversary simply needs to pay the proposer more than a transaction’s tip above the base fee to not include it.\nIf the fee mechanism is a first-price auction, an adversary would have to pay the proposer more than the entirety of a user’s bid to incentivize them to not include the transaction.\nNote that bidders are expected to only pay tiny tips under EIP-1559. Thus while the bids under a first price auction are expected to be relatively small in comparison to a transaction’s true value, they are still substantially higher than what the transaction’s tip would be in EIP-1559. Thus we would say that Ethereum using a first price auction as its TFM is\nmore\nshort-term censorship resistant than Ethereum using EIP-1559. In either case, however, if the equilibrium price for inclusion for a Defi transaction is high enough to deter an adversary, users now have to pay a hefty tax to the protocol in turn making the Defi app itself less attractive.\nProblem 2: Enshrined proposer latency advantages\nIn a single proposer architecture, the proposer is by design the last one to move in the block production game for a given slot. (In practice there is a complicated offchain transaction supply chain where relays move last. For the purposes of this post we treat proposers and builders as combined.) This means that proposers can always submit transactions that reflect a “fresher” state compared to any other submitted transactions. Even if both users and the proposer receive information simultaneously, it takes time for users to send their transactions to the proposer, during which new information might arrive. The proposer is in a position to instantly react to this information and potentially change their transaction, but the user has no time to do this.\nFor example, the optimal way to route a trade onchain may depend on the offchain ETH-USD price on Binance. In a single proposer architecture, a sophisticated proposer can submit trades that are more up-to-date than any users competing for the same trade.\nExample\nConsider our previous example of a dapp selling an item every slot via first-price auction. But now the item’s value is a function of constantly updating information. Assume there are two bidders competing for the item, agents 1 and 2. Both agents hear new information simultaneously, except agent 1 always gets to bid after agent 2. In this case, agent 2 is adversely selected against when they win because the only time bidder 2 wins is when the information updates after they submit their bid to the point that they are over paying. Otherwise, whenever the information changes so that bidder 2’s bid is profitable, bidder 1 will simply update their bid in response to the newer information and win the auction. This effect is especially stark when agent 1 can directly observe agent 2’s bid, but even if agent 1 can’t see agent 2’s bid, agent 1 still has a substantial competitive advantage. In the long run, agent 2 will not find it worth it to participate, letting agent 1 capture all the value from the auction.\nThis example shows how structural advantages given to the proposer can cause competition to dry up and drive all the surplus value from onchain markets to the proposer.\nPossible solutions depend on the roadmap\nThe extent to which short-term censorship resistance and proposer latency advantages matter depend on the Ethereum development roadmap. One vision for Ethereum’s future is fully embracing the L2 roadmap and having all meaningful execution happen offchain, with Ethereum being used for settlement, data availability, and proof-verification. In such a world, short-term censorship is the main problem, although achieving it over the span of ~10 blocks may be sufficient rather than the block-level guarantees we described above. An alternative path is for Ethereum to serve as a hub for high value execution, and in particular for high-value Defi. In this world, achieving strong short-term censorship resistance and alleviating proposers’ strong structural economic advantages becomes essential.\nTwo alternatives help address these problems. The first is a\nconstrained single proposer architecture\nthat adds committees which bind the proposer’s action space. The second is a\nmulti-proposer architecture\nthat looks dramatically different from Ethereum’s current design: It splits the proposer’s power among many different parties.\nWhile both designs are still in active development, there have been proposals of what these architectures might look like. We outline what these proposals look like and analyze how they address the problems we’ve discussed.\nA case for FOCIL\nConstrained single proposer architecture\nA constrained single proposer architecture is one where a committee within the same block imposes constraints on the proposer. Inclusion lists (ILs) are the most natural example of this, where an inclusion committee enforces that a block proposer include certain transactions the committee hears about.\nThe amount of power the committee has varies in different designs. One important distinction is between unconditional and conditional inclusion lists. With unconditional inclusion lists, the transactions the committee includes must be included by a proposer for the block to be valid. With conditional inclusion lists, a block only has to include the contents of the inclusion list conditioned on the block not being full, meaning that if the proposer fills the entire block with their own transactions, they aren’t required to include any transactions in the inclusion list. While unconditional ILs can offer better short-term censorship resistance, they might also be easier to crowd out because they might be used to offer products like preconfirmations.\nThe latest proposal for a constrained single proposer design on Ethereum is called FOCIL (fork choice conditional inclusion lists), which lays out how to implement inclusion lists (FOCIL is not explicitly designed to deal with high-value MEV transactions but is instead optimized for censorship resistance over the span of a few blocks. Nevertheless, as it’s the most concrete specification of what a constrained-single proposer architecture could look like, it’s useful to analyze it in this setting.)\nThe high-level design is as follows (for details, see “\nFOCIL CL & EL workflow\n”): Every slot a subset of validators are chosen as inclusion committee members. Committee members construct their lists of transactions up to a local IL size limit (in KB). These lists are locked ¾ of the way through the slot and gossiped to the proposer, who is then responsible for appending any transactions they are missing in the list to their block, until their block hits the gas limit. Then, in addition to standard block validity rules, attesters also check that proposed blocks are conformant against the corresponding inclusion lists. Note, there are no economic incentives in the protocol for the inclusion list committee to act honestly.\nAnalysis\nShort-term censorship resistance\nThe short-term censorship resistance of a constrained single proposer scheme depends on what types of constraints are allowed and how the proposer is bound to them. As we define short-term censorship via an economic model, the details of how the inclusion committee is incentivized can also change the relative power of these mechanisms. We will start by analyzing FOCIL with EIP-1559 as the L1 TFM before expanding on what is possible in the space of constrained single proposer mechanisms.\nSince FOCIL does not explicitly incentivize the inclusion committee to include any transactions, let’s assume that the inclusion list committee is non-strategic and acts honestly. FOCIL also doesn’t specify what inclusion rule honest IL committee members should follow, but for our analysis we assume that honest IL members will include transactions they hear about with the highest priority fees. (FOCIL’s goal is to also increase censorship resistance on longer time scales than a slot, so the intention is that some committee members also follow inclusion rules such as including transactions that have been in the mempool the longest.)\nNow consider an instance where an adversary is targeting a transaction that tips $10 on top of the base fee, and that $10 is sufficiently high to make the transaction included in the IL. The adversary here has two options. They can either send enough transactions above a $10 tip in the mempool to kick the target transaction out of the IL while also bribing the proposer $10 to not include the target; or the adversary could send enough transactions to fill the proposer’s block and also still send the proposer with $10 to not include the target transaction. Either of these strategies is significantly more expensive for the adversary than the status quo of only paying the proposer $10 to not include the target transaction. In the former case, the adversary has to pay the priority fee plus base fee for any of the transactions that ends up landing on chain; in the later case the adversary has to pay at least the base fee to fill the entire block (assuming EIP-1559 as the base layer TFM).\nIf FOCIL instead used unconditional inclusion lists, the second attack vector would be ruled out. Thus, if the target transaction had a high tip, then the adversary would be put in the position of filling the IL gas limit with transactions having tips above the target, which is potentially much more expensive than paying the base fee to fill the entire block.\nThe key assumption in this analysis is that the IL committee acts honestly while being non-strategic. If the inclusion committee were strategic, then the adversary could pay them an arbitrarily small amount to produce empty lists in the current protocol. Without any mechanism incentivizing the IL committee to follow the protocol, analyzing the short-term censorship resistance of these protocols reduces to the standard single proposer case. Fee mechanism design that allows fees of transactions included by the IL committee to go to the IL committee can help increase the robustness of these protocols, but the details of such designs and the properties they would satisfy are the subject of future work (for instance, see\nthis example\n).\nProposer latency advantage\nConstraints like ILs alone don’t help address proposers’ latency advantages. In these designs, the single proposer still moves last and still has the power to insert whatever transactions they like. In general, the constrained single proposer setting has difficulty addressing this problem because any form of a constraint committee must act before the end of a slot for the proposer to have time to hear the outcome of the constraint and act accordingly. Thus, the proposer has the privileged position to act on any information that arrives in this duration. The only way around this is for a committee, rather than the proposer, to end the block production game, in which case we move toward a multi-proposer architecture.\nA case for multi-proposer\nMulti-proposer architecture\nA multi-proposer architecture explicitly has multiple proposers jointly building a block every slot. Many potential instantions exist, but multi-proposer schemes generally have a similar structure: A set of validators is chosen randomly by stake as proposers in a given slot. At the end of the slot, each chosen validator proposes a set of transactions following a local block validity rule. Then the protocol deterministically aggregates these proposals into a single canonical block.\nThe key feature of multi-proposer schemes is that no single proposer is given special power over what gets included in a block. Even though the multiple proposers in such a scheme have advantages compared to non-proposers, the competition between proposers themselves can lead to improved market equilibria.\nAs opposed to the constrained single proposer setting that is additive to the current Ethereum protocol, a multi-proposer architecture would require a fundamental rework of Ethereum. As such, many components have to be reasoned about, including the transaction supply chain, consensus, and fee mechanisms. Here, we will consider an idealized model of a multi-proposer architecture where the consensus details are worked out and we can focus on a single slot in isolation. Assumptions include that all the proposers are homogenous and have equal access to information, and that the aggregation rule is simply taking a union over all proposed transactions. (This analysis holds for any reasonable choice of ordering rule.) A large part of bringing multi-proposer to production will be relaxing these assumptions to create a full specification, but even with this simple model there is still much to consider.\nAnalysis\nShort-term censorship resistance\nThe short-term censorship resistance of a multi-proposer architecture depends on the TFM being used. For example, schemes that evenly distribute fees across all proposers and are pay-as-bid for users can incentivize better throughput but worse short-term censorship resistance than you would get from current single proposer schemes. On the other hand, some proposal TFMs look to take advantage of multi-proposer architectures to get more censorship resistance than would be possible in a single proposal scheme.\nFor example,\nFox, Pai, and Resnick.\nmake the observation that having a transaction’s payment be a function of how many proposers include a transaction can drastically increase the cost to censor the transaction. Their TFM has users submit a pair of bids\n(t,T)\nwith\nt<<T\n. If\nk>1\nproposers include the transaction. The transaction pays\nkt\nwith\nt\ngoing to each of the corresponding proposers. However, if only one proposer includes the transaction, then the transaction pays\nT\nto the single block producer. Hence, an adversary has to pay\nkT\nto censor the transaction, since any validator can unilaterally deviate to include the transaction if no one else is, while the transaction only expects to pay\nΘ(t)\nfor inclusion.\nThis gap between how much a transaction has to pay for inclusion and the cost to censor it, is a key property that comes from proposers competing among themselves. A censoring adversary needs to make payments such that\nnone\nof the proposers include the transaction. Of course, if the proposers all collude, this analysis breaks down and the benefits of multi-proposer is lost — potentially leaving us in a worse situation than the single proposer case. However, as the number of concurrent proposers increases, both the amount an adversary has to pay to induce a censoring equilibrium and the difficulty of maintaining the collusion increase since even one proposer deviating from the censoring ring would be sufficient to regain short-term censorship resistance properties.\nProposer latency advantage\nAssume no proposer can see other proposers’ blocks before they make their own block. Perfect synchrony could achieve this, but, more practically, cryptography can achieve the same end. Proposers can use time lock encryption to have their block contents hidden only for a few seconds. Thus, if proposers all release their blocks a couple seconds before the end of the slot, proposers can’t see each other’s blocks until the slot has passed. Instead of time lock encryption we could also threshold encrypt block contents to an attester committee to achieve a similar property.\nGiven this assumption, there is no party who moves last to end the block production game. This means that proposers are forced to compete with one another on an equal playing field to take advantage of opportunities at the application layer.  As new information comes in, all proposers are in an equal position to react and update their transactions. This competition then keeps this value within the application layer and allows a competitive market to exist instead of having the market unravel and letting the value all leak to a single proposer. Note, however, that a multi-proposer scheme doesn’t change the structural advantage proposers have over users, since users still face a latency delay in getting their transactions to the proposer. But now instead of a single party with the advantage, there are multiple parties with equal advantages.\nThe exact details of how to implement the cryptography so proposers can’t see each others’ blocks before they propose their own are crucial to maintaining this property. Otherwise, certain proposers again have structural market advantages over others, degrading the competitiveness of onchain markets. These specifications are still largely works in progress.\n***\nIf the main concern Ethereum has to solve is short-term censorship resistance, constrained single proposer designs have appealing properties while also being close to well specified enough with proposals like FOCIL to be implemented. On the other hand, if Ethereum’s success also relies on addressing some of the negative market effects of single proposer schemes on the application layer, more drastic change is likely needed. Multi-proposer schemes look promising to address the broader space of issues. But since these designs completely restructure the Ethereum stack, they have a longer path ahead of them in getting to a complete specification and addressing all the potential second-order effects of such large changes.\n***\nAcknowledgments: Thanks to Barnabe, Joachim, Julian, Max, and Thomas for helpful comments and suggestions\n***\nPranav Garimidi\nis a research analyst at a16z crypto.

        "content": "We’ve been flooded with crypto founders asking us what the recent election means for their projects. We have told them that we have an incredible opportunity to build on the bipartisan progress from the last Congress and bring the best of crypto to the world.\nOver the next few months, expect to hear a range of speculation and “hot takes” about what will happen from a legislative and regulatory perspective – the vast majority of it will just be noise. The truth is that it’s too early to tell how everything will shake out, but what we do know is that it is significant for the industry. We’re very optimistic that the government will now foster innovation, accelerate progress, and enable the crypto ecosystem to thrive in the U.S.\nThis will enable a future where we can deliver on the many consumer benefits that we’ve been excited about: giving people ownership over their digital identities,\nnew business models for creatives\n, low to no-fee cross border transactions with stablecoins, new ways for small businesses like restaurants to engage with their customers, the emergence of decentralized social networks, development of physical infrastructure like energy grids, as well as blockchains democratizing AI and games, and so much more that we can’t even imagine yet.\nThe good news is that there is now a pathway for constructive engagement with regulatory agencies and legislation that can bring regulatory clarity. You should now all feel empowered to explore all of the groundbreaking products and services that blockchains enable, including tokens. While we’ll likely have greater flexibility to experiment, we can’t forget that the fundamental regulatory principles applicable to blockchain systems remain unchanged. This means that “where there is trust, there is regulation” still applies. So, you should continue to focus on removing centralized aspects or dependencies on trust within your projects, as these are the areas that continue to attract regulatory scrutiny.\nNext year, we’ll advocate for clear regulatory frameworks that foster and bolster innovation and decentralization. This is both an opportunity and a responsibility for builders – you can actively shape this future by developing projects that demonstrate how decentralized protocols eliminate risks and justify new regulatory approaches.\nThis will provide well-meaning entrepreneurs with a pathway to decentralization, while also protecting consumers by making sure scams and frauds are caught early.\nThere will still be\nvalid scrutiny from regulators and policymakers of certain aspects of the industry irrespective of progress on new legislation or a re-calibrated regulatory environment.\nThis is particularly true for token issuances, where the principles-based guidance in our\nToken Launch Playbook\nstill applies.\nWe should expect a future where these clear rules\nwill make it easier to identify and shut down bad actors, similar to FTX, while allowing well meaning projects to take off. This will both protect consumers and rebuild trust and confidence in the technology. The previous approach of regulation by enforcement, with no regulatory clarity, both blocked good actors and allowed bad actors, which actively harmed consumers and unfairly eroded trust in the space.\nHowever, for many of you who have delayed using tokens to distribute control of your project and build community due to fears of regulatory overreach, you should now have greater confidence in your project’s use of tokens as a legitimate and lawful tool. We’ll also soon release new guidance on the use of the\nDecentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA)\nfor projects looking to make the U.S. home, insulate tokenholders from liability, manage tax and compliance needs, and enable\ngreater economic activity\n. ​\nThe future of crypto in the U.S. is bright – it’s the perfect time to build here, and we’re excited about the possibility for regulatory clarity to finally come.\n***\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

        "content": "Digital marketplaces are becoming increasingly vital for the real-world adoption of emerging technologies. Gerry Tsoukalas (Boston University) examines their pricing structures, highlighting that while most use simple commission contracts to generate revenue, control over pricing varies: it may be centralized with the platform or decentralized, left to individual agents. We show these choices critically affect market outcomes (supply, adoption, welfare, etc.). Centralization enhances coordination but increases information asymmetry between the platform and its agents, whereas decentralization reverses this tradeoff. Neither approach is universally optimal. Using mechanism design, we propose a structural tweak to commission contracts, termed “affine pricing,” that can enable optimal market outcomes under either form of pricing control. We discuss implications for both established and emerging disintermediated web3 marketplaces governed by smart contracts.\nAbout the presenter\nGerry is an Associate Professor of Information Systems at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business, with secondary appointments at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell’s FinTech Initiative, and the Luohan Academy (Alibaba Group). Specializing in digital platforms and analytics (AI/ML), he co-founded the Crypto and Blockchain Economics Research Forum (CBER).

        "content": "Ethan Bueno de Mesquita (University of Chicago) considers a model of the effects of competition from AI on production and innovation by content creators — introducing prices, which are often ignored, into the analysis. Human producers create content that is both sold directly to consumers and used as training data for AI. The AI generates a substitute good for human-generated content at zero marginal cost; the more training data the AI has access to, the higher quality the AI-generated content. The higher the quality of AI-generated content, the more consumers substitute away from human generated content, the lower the market price of human-generated content, the less human-generated content is produced, and the lower the profits to the human producers.\nEthan shows that, despite the fact that AI crowds out human production, because of price adjustments, exogenous improvements in the ability of AI to translate data into high-quality content, can benefit consumers. He also explores the effects of improvements in AI on innovation by human producers. He captures this by allowing for the possibility that human producers can pay a fixed cost to create a new product for which there is not any pre-existing training data, showing that exogenous improvements in AI can have non-monotone effects on the amount of innovation.\nAbout the presenter\nEthan is the Dean and Sydney Stein Professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. He is a political scientist whose research applies game theoretic models to the study of political violence, national security, electoral politics, and technology and society; he has also written extensively on methodological issues in the social sciences. He writes and advises leaders in the public and private sectors on both national security matters and issues at the intersection of technology and society. He is the author or co-author of Political Economy for Public Policy, Theory and Credibility, and Thinking Clearly with Data (all from Princeton University Press). His research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, and the United States Institute of Peace.\nAbout a16z crypto research\na16z crypto research is a multidisciplinary lab that works closely with our portfolio companies and others toward solving the important problems in the space, and toward advancing the science and technology of the next generation of the internet.\nMore about us:\na16z.com/2022/04/21/announcing-a16z-crypto-research More from the a16z crypto team – Subscribe to our ‘web3 weekly newsletter’: a16zcrypto.substack.com – Listen to our ‘web3 with a16z’ podcast: a16zcrypto.com/web3-with-a16z-podcast/ – Read more of our work: a16zcrypto.com"

        "content": "Editor’s note: This post originally appeared in our\nnewsletter\n— a guide to trending topics in crypto with insights and resources from engineers, researchers, and others on the a16z crypto team.\nSubscribe\nto see it in your inbox every other week.\nWelcome to our elections special edition, where we cover the resurgence of interest in citizens assemblies, research into “liquid” democracy, advances in onchain voting, and more.\nWe’re just days away from U.S. elections on November 5, and an increasing number of policymakers and politicians have been speaking positively about crypto on both sides of the aisle.\nRegardless of who wins office, many politicians expect bipartisan crypto legislation to be on the next government’s agenda.\na16z crypto\nState of Crypto Report 2024\n, p. 10\nCrypto has become a key\npolitical issue\n. It’s on the ballot; go\nhere\nfor more election resources.\nWhat happens when anyone can be your representative?\nAndrew Hall\nLewis Carroll, a prolific researcher of voting systems (and author of\nAlice in Wonderland\n), first proposed something like so-called liquid democracy. The idea is simple: You can vote directly on issues, or you can delegate your vote.\nFascinating, but impractical in the 19th century. Today, though, computers and the internet have made it easier for communities to implement. Crypto projects have been putting the concept into practice — which has given researchers lots of data to assess just how well liquid democracy actually works.\nAndrew Hall, Stanford political scientist and advisor to a16z crypto research, and fellow researcher Sho Miyazaki, collected onchain data from 18 Ethereum DAOs from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023.\nDrawing on a dataset that covers over 250,000 voters and 1,700 proposals, here’s what they found:\nAbout 17% of voting power gets delegated\nSmall token holders are more likely to delegate than larger token holders\nMore active voters attract more delegations\nBuilding online tools to help voters find and evaluate delegates boosts participation by 25%\nIf crypto communities want to encourage more participation — a key milestone on the path to decentralization — Hall has a handful of suggestions that could move the needle. Among them:\nBuild delegation hubs that help users easily delegate their vote\nHelp voters make informed choices by clearly explaining what’s at stake\nIncentivize token holders to delegate and vote more often\nRead more\nGovernment… by lottery?\nWhen experts can’t be trusted, draw lots.\nThe latest episode of\nweb3 with a16z\nexamines the ancient Athenian practice of “sortition,” which delegates decision-making power to random members of the public.\nSometimes called “government by lottery,” sortition — and the closely related concept of citizens’ assemblies — are undergoing a revival today as tech companies (like Meta) and AI startups (like OpenAI and Anthropic) use this method to shape their policies.\nSortition can apply everywhere, from the governance of countries to the governance of crypto projects. Joining us to discuss the trend are political scientists Bailey Flanigan (Harvard now, MIT next year) and Andrew Hall (Stanford).\nListen here\nSpeaking of voting…\nYou can also visit our library of\nresources\nfor all things voting and governance, including how systems can be\ngamed\n, how to make onchain voting more\nprivate\n, and more.

Electoral Competition under Ranked Choice Voting\nBailey Flanigan (Harvard) talked about her work on sortition, or governance by lottery — an increasingly popular practice in online communities, including AI and crypto projects:\nAlgorithms for Fair, Manipulation-Robust, and Transparent Sortition\n🔮\nElection-betting market moves\nInterest in prediction and election-betting markets has surged ahead of the U.S. elections. Kalshi, a prediction market platform that’s registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, started accepting USDC stablecoin deposits on Monday, while Robinhood introduced election betting contracts on the same day. Meanwhile, an analysis of Polymarket found signs of wash trading on the offshore platform’s presidential betting market.

ConsenSys, maker of the MetaMask wallet, is laying off 160+ employees, in part because of SEC lawfare. “Multiple cases with the SEC, including ours, represent meaningful jobs and productive investment lost due to the SEC’s abuse of power and Congress’s inability to rectify the problem,” writes founder and CEO Joe Lubin. “Such attacks from the U.S. government will end up costing many companies…many millions of dollars.” (\nConsenSys\n)\nChangelog: Helios is now a multichain light client for Ethereum\nWhat’s changed\n: We’ve revamped\nHelios\n, our open source light client, to make it agnostic to how blocks are verified, and added support for modifying the underlying execution environment to suit differences between rollups.\nWe’ve started with the OP Stack, meaning Helios can now sync on Optimism, Base, Unichain, World Chain, and anything else within the Superchain ecosystem.
