        "title": "5 crypto issues both parties agree on",
        "url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/bipartisan-crypto-issues/",
        "content": "During the holidays there’s no shortage of hot-button political issues to debate around the dinner table. With crypto front-and-center this year, it’s bound to be one of them. But here’s how you can maintain peace amongst the family.\nEveryone knows that crypto has become a key political issue, even playing a role in the recent U.S. elections, as we detailed in our\n2024 State of Crypto Report\n. What may be less appreciated is that there’s growing bipartisan consensus about the importance of blockchain networks and the rules the industry needs to thrive, spur innovation, and protect consumers. Yes, crypto is bipartisan.\nSoon dozens of new, pro-crypto representatives — both Democrats and Republicans — will enter Congress. We’re\nvery optimistic\nthat a strong bipartisan majority of policymakers will work across the aisle to promote new technologies, accelerate progress, and enable the next generation of the internet to flourish in the U.S.\nSo to help equip you for an inevitable topic of conversation at your holiday gatherings, we’ve put together a list of five top areas of crypto policy that both parties agree on.\n1. Crypto gives more choice to users, creators, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and others\nHundreds of U.S. representatives\nare starting to recognize the benefits of crypto and blockchain technologies, including as an alternative — and counter — to Big Tech. They see the potential for decentralized systems to create a democratized, user-controlled internet that promotes competition, while safeguarding user freedoms and rewarding contributors, creators, and other participants.\nCrypto’s value proposition isn’t just hypothetical, it’s tangible: Crypto projects are already giving people ownership over their\ndigital identities\n, helping creators\nmonetize their work\n, and providing\nnew ways\nfor small businesses like restaurants to engage with their customers. More and more, policymakers on the left and right are seeing how crypto can help combat Big Tech overreach by democratizing AI, by offering user-controlled alternatives to centralized social media platforms, by decentralizing physical infrastructure like energy grids, and more.\nAt the highest levels of both parties, lawmakers are leaning in. “We all believe in the future of crypto,” Senate Majority Leader\nChuck Schumer (D-NY)\nhas said\n: “I want to bring members on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate together…so we can pass sensible [crypto] legislation that helps the United States maintain its status as the most innovative country in the world.” Senator Schumer’s remarks dovetail with recent statements from President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to make the U.S. the “\ncrypto capital of the planet\n.”\n2. Government needs to pass laws and enact regulation\nLegislators from both major parties acknowledge that the crypto market needs laws — and the time to pass them is now.\nSenator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Representative Patrick McHenry (R-NC)\nsay\nthat passing a comprehensive market structure bill for crypto is a top priority. “We just can’t wait anymore, Europe is way ahead of us,” Sen. Lummis says. Their Democratic colleague Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) concurs,\nsaying that\nrepresentatives have been “working hard to develop a comprehensive cryptocurrency framework.” As does Democratic Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA), who underscores the problematic ambiguity of the status quo,\nsaying that\ncrypto builders “are focused on innovating and creating jobs in the U.S. An already difficult task made tougher without clear guardrails or regulation.”\nThese recent affirmations come amid a wave of progress toward the development of bipartisan crypto market structure legislation. New law would help clarify how regulators should treat digital assets and whose jurisdiction they would fall under. Earlier this year, the U.S. House of Representatives\npassed\none such bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (\nFIT21\n), with overwhelming bipartisan support. Seventy-one House Democrats\nvoted in favor\nof this landmark bill, which would give blockchain-based projects a pathway to safely and effectively launch in the U.S., while incentivizing decentralization and safeguarding users.\nCongress is now poised to build on this momentum and finally pass market structure legislation. Clear rules of the road would foster decentralized innovation, protect consumers by regulating centralized intermediaries operating in crypto markets, and establish swimlanes for the regulatory agencies overseeing these markets.\n3. Stablecoins strengthen the U.S. and advance America’s interests at home and abroad\nStablecoins are tokens whose price is pegged, often to a currency. They offer users a frictionless, low-to-no-fee way to transfer value at the speed of the internet. Millions of people around the world\nhave already\ntransacted trillions of dollars using stablecoins to make cross-border payments, transact online, engage in decentralized finance (DeFi), and more.\nStablecoins offer opportunities for users and businesses, and also for the country. The vast majority of stablecoin transactions involve two assets: USDT and USDC, both of which are pegged to the U.S. dollar. As foreign sovereign digital currencies compete for traction, stablecoins — 99% of which are\ndenominated in USD\n, thereby\nstrengthening the U.S. dollar’s status globally — have already found product-market fit.\nPolicymakers from both major parties are recognizing the need to update rules in light of stablecoins’ adoption. During a recent Securities and Exchange Commission oversight hearing, the House Financial Services Committee’s ranking Democrat Maxine Waters (D-CA)\ncalled\na stablecoin bill “long overdue” and asserted that “we can reach a deal that prioritizes strong protections for our nation’s consumers and strong federal oversight.” Representative McHenry agreed,\nresponding\nthat he aims to “come to terms on stablecoin legislation this Congress.”\nEffective stablecoin legislation would advance America’s interests and help foster secure, transparent, and consumer-friendly markets at home and abroad. Commonsense protections would include requiring issuers to fully back their tokens with high-quality liquid assets such as cash or U.S. treasuries, and requiring their reserves to be regularly audited by independent third-parties. Rules for stablecoins would also establish robust requirements for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, and they would use the\ninherent traceability\nof blockchains to combat illicit finance.\nCrucially, legislation should also allow builders to create\ndecentralized stablecoins\n, since these can rely on assets that exist natively on a blockchain where they are generally free from the counterparty risks that arise from custodying assets with intermediaries. Without third parties, such stablecoins can achieve true decentralization, taking advantage of its\nnumerous benefits\n.\n4. Everyone has the right to a bank account — even crypto companies\nOperation chokepoint (1.0) was a\nconcerted effort\nby the Department of Justice, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to shutter controversial businesses by cutting off their access to the banking system. In its initial manifestation, the operation targeted payday lenders, coin dealers, gun shops, and marijuana dispensaries — all of which are legal businesses.\nLeveraging similar tactics, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 has sought to curtail the crypto industry by restricting crypto businesses’ and their associated individuals’ access to banks. Pressure from policymakers including Senator\nElizabeth Warren\n(D-MA), agencies such as the\nFederal Reserve, FDIC, OCC,\nand others have attempted to cut off crypto businesses’ access to the banking system. On multiple occasions, federal banking agencies have also\nasserted\nthat issuing or holding crypto as principal is likely inconsistent with sound banking practices. Certain banks were even\nadvised\nto limit their own crypto offerings, according to documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.\nAs with Operation Chokepoint 1.0, crypto businesses are not being punished for breaking the law, but rather for being out of favor with certain policymakers and regulatory agencies. Fortunately, lawmakers are now aware of the overreach. In a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN)\nasserted\nthat “there’s been a coordinated chorus of regulators talking about severing crypto from our financial system,” while drawing a comparison to the original Operation Choke Point.\nThere is now emerging bipartisan consensus that federal agencies have effectively — and capriciously — restricted crypto firms’ access to banking services. Regulators should immediately end this approach, which constrains legitimate businesses’ access to essential financial infrastructure.\n5. We need to fight bad actors and curb illicit activity\nMedia coverage of crypto too often emphasizes\nallegations of money laundering\n, while ignoring the technologies’ exciting and innovative uses. These stories mislead: Blockchain analytics firms\nestimate\nthat transactions associated with illicit activity made up only 0.34% of all cryptocurrency activity in 2023 and 0.42% in 2022 — and these figures equate to just a tiny fraction of the dollar’s use in illicit finance.\nOf course, bad actors may still use blockchain networks for illicit transactions, just as cyber criminals use computer networks to steal people’s data and bank robbers use cars and highway networks to conduct heists. Crime is not the fault of these technologies. Criminal activity can be addressed through tailored, effective, law enforcement efforts that mitigate illicit finance risk while realizing the benefits of these technologies.\nPerhaps the most pressing threats that need to be addressed are cybersecurity-related hacks and thefts by sanctioned state actors like the DPRK. Lawmakers agree that better guardrails are required to combat bad actors — especially rogue states such as the DPRK — from exploiting crypto for their gain. The Treasury Department has already\nsignaled support\nfor several steps that the government can take to stem attacks by bad foreign actors, which we’ve\noutlined here\n. That includes augmenting the government’s ability to crack down on foreign bad actors by amending the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) to clearly authorize extraterritorial jurisdiction under certain circumstances. It also includes enhancing Treasury’s enforcement capacities to address compliance failures.\n***\nCrypto is bipartisan. Democrats, republicans, and independents share common ground on many of the industry’s most pressing issues. We hope that this list helps clarify that, while Americans may disagree about a lot of things, crypto shouldn’t be one of them. Broad and growing support for the industry now exists, as well as a commitment to providing the regulatory clarity needed for crypto to deliver on its promise of creating a democratized user-controlled internet.\n***\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

        "title": "16 insights from New York Times bestseller Read Write Own",
        "url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/read-write-own-book-excerpts/",
        "content": "Looking for a better understanding of the tech, business, and startup worlds? A primer on the history and future of the internet? A crisp explanation of the crypto and blockchain movements, and why they matter? We’ve got you.\nHere, we’ve gathered some of the sharpest excerpts and most provocative ideas from the\nNew York Times\nBest Seller\nRead Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet\n. The book is densely packed with insights about the hidden structures that dictate the flow of power and money online. Author and a16z crypto Founder and Managing Partner Chris Dixon draws on his decades-long career investing in startups to reveal what makes the networks that determine so much of our lives tick, as well as how they can be rewired to empower internet users and transform them into\nowners\n.\nThe ideas in\nRead Write Own\nexplore new ways of thinking that can advance you in business and in life — from cultivating innovation, to staying ahead of disruption, to placing contrarian bets. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has called the book “a compelling vision of where the internet should go and how to get there.” Whether you’re passionate about crypto, playing catch-up, or simply curious to learn what all the to-do is about, the book offers something for everyone.\nHere are some of the most compelling excerpts, each a valuable takeaway in itself.\n1. The nature of permission\nIn business, permission seeking is not like asking your parents or teachers for permission, where you get a simple yes or no answer. Nor is it like traffic lights setting the rules of the road. In business, permission becomes a pretense for tyranny. Dominant tech businesses leverage the power of permission to thwart competition, desolate markets, and extract rents. (p. xvi)\n2. Software as art\nSoftware is so expressive that it is better thought of not as engineering but as an art form. The plasticity and flexibility of code offer an immensely rich design space, far closer in the breadth of possibilities to creative activities like sculpting and fiction writing than engineering activities like bridge building. As with other art forms, practitioners regularly develop new genres and movements that fundamentally shift what’s possible. (p. xx)\n3. The problems blockchains solve\nThe ability for blockchains to make strong commitments about how they will behave in the future allows\nnew networks\nto be created. Blockchain networks solve problems that plague earlier network architectures. They can connect people in social networks while empowering users over corporate interests. They can underpin marketplaces and payment networks that facilitate commerce, but with persistently lower take rates. They can enable new forms of monetizable media, interoperable and immersive digital worlds, and artificial intelligence products that compensate — rather than cannibalize — creators….\nAsking “What problems do blockchains solve?” is like asking “What problems does steel solve over, say, wood?” You can make a building or railway out of either. But steel gave us taller buildings, stronger railways, and more ambitious public works at the outset of the Industrial Revolution. With blockchains we can create networks that are fairer, more durable, and more resilient than the networks of today. (pp. xxiii–xxiv)\n4. A new internet era\nThe decisions we make now will determine the internet’s future: who builds, owns, and uses it; where innovation happens; and what the experience will be for everyone. Blockchains, and the networks they enable, unlock the extraordinary power of software as an art form, with the internet as its canvas. The movement has an opportunity to change the course of history, to remake humanity’s relationship to the digital, to reimagine what’s possible…. This is a chance to create the internet you want, not the internet you inherited. (p. xxviii)\n5. The supremacy of networks\nNetwork design is destiny.\nNetworks are the organizing framework that enables billions of people to intelligibly interact. They decide the world’s winners and losers. Their algorithms decide where money and attention will flow. The structure of a network guides how that network will evolve and where wealth and power accumulate. Given the scale of the internet today, software design decisions up front, regardless of how seemingly small, can have cascading downstream consequences. Who controls a given network is the central question when analyzing power on the internet. (p. 3)\n6. Protocols vs. corporations\nThe difference between a protocol network like email and a corporate network like Twitter is that email’s network effect accrues to a community instead of a company. No company owns or controls email and anyone can access it through software created by independent developers that supports the underlying protocol. It’s up to developers and consumers to decide what to build and use. Decisions that affect the community are made by the community. (p. 18)\n7. The impact of new technologies\nPeople use new technologies in one of two ways: (1) to do something they could already do but can now do faster, cheaper, easier, or higher quality; or (2) to do something brand-new that they simply couldn’t do before. Early in the development of new technologies, the first category of activities tends to be more popular, but it’s the second set that has more lasting effects on the world. (p. 27)\n8. The corporate-controlled internet\nCorporate networks have a simple structure. In the middle, a company controls centralized services that power the network. This company has complete control. It can rewrite its terms of service, determine who has access, and redirect how money flows, at any time, for any reason. Corporate networks are centralized because there is ultimately one person, usually the chief executive officer, who makes all the rules. (p. 31)\n9. Blockchains as non-consensus bet\nBlockchains are different. They’re a non-consensus bet. While plenty of people recognize their potential — including me — much of the establishment disregards them. In fact, a prevailing view in the tech industry assumes that the only vectors of technological improvement that matter are the ones incumbents are already focused on: bigger databases, faster processors, larger neural networks, smaller devices. The view is myopic. (p. 52)\n10. How hobbies fuel future industries\nOutside-in technologies arrive, in contrast, on the fringes. Hobbyists, enthusiasts, open-source developers, and startup founders hatch them outside the mainstream. The work usually involves less capital and formal training, which helps level the playing field with insiders. A lower bar also causes insiders to take these technologies and their proponents less seriously…. Hobbies fuel future industries…. Hobbies are what the smartest people spend time on when they aren’t constrained by near-term financial goals. I like to say that what the smartest people do on the weekends is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years. (pp. 53–54)\n11. The simplicity of tokens\nWhat tokens\nare\nmatters less than what they\ndo\n.\nTokens can represent the ownership of anything digital, including money, art, photos, music, text, code, game items, voting power, access, or whatever people come up with next. Using some additional building blocks, they can also represent real-world things, like physical goods, real estate, or dollars in a bank account. Anything that can be represented in code can be wrapped inside a token to be bought, sold, used, stored, embedded, transferred, or whatever else a person might want to do with it. If that sounds so simple as to seem trivial, that’s by design. Simplicity is a virtue. (p. 72)\n12. Owners vs. users\nThe concept of ownership is so deeply embedded in our lives that it’s difficult to imagine how the world would look if that were taken away. Imagine if the clothes you bought could be worn only in the venue you bought them in. What if you couldn’t resell or reinvest in your house or car? Or what if you had to change your name wherever you went? This is the digital world of corporate networks. (p. 80)\n13. Blockchains as cities\nBlockchain functions have neat analogues in urban planning. Starting a blockchain network is like building a new city on undeveloped land. The city designer constructs some initial buildings and then designs a system of land grants and tax incentives for residents and developers. Property rights — ownership — play a key role, providing strong commitments that property owners will get to keep what they own and can feel comfortable investing in it. As the city grows, so does the tax base. Taxes are reinvested into public projects like streets and parks, more land is given away, and the city grows. (p. 97)\n14. Restoring community through tokens\nBlockchain networks bake community ownership into their core design. It’s in their DNA. While memecoin mutations, like Dogecoin, may seem like a joke, they show how users are embracing all sorts of tokens — some silly, some serious — in search of community, to fill the void left by corporate networks. The internet was originally envisioned as a decentralized network owned and controlled by its participants. Tokens restore that vision. (p. 140)\n15. Blockchains as network constitutions\nNetwork designers can use blockchains to create formal rules that are enforced by code. These rules are like constitutions for networks. What these constitutions say is subject to debate, contention, and experimentation, but their very existence, the ability to enshrine rules in immutable software, is a meaningful advance that was not possible in previous network designs.\n(p. 167)\n16. Crypto’s two cultures\nTwo distinct cultures are interested in blockchains. The first sees blockchains as a way to build new networks…. I call this culture the\ncomputer\nbecause, at its core, it’s about blockchains powering a new computing movement. … The other culture is mainly interested in speculation and money-making. Those of this mindset see blockchains solely as a way to create new tokens for trading. I call this culture the\ncasino\nbecause, at its core, it’s really just about gambling. … The casino should not hold the computer down. (pp. 171, 181)\nBonus: The good old days\nBlockchains are at the computing frontier, as PCs were in the 1980s, the internet was in the 1990s, and mobile phones were in the 2010s. People look back today on classic moments in computing and wonder what it was like to be there. Noyce and Moore. Jobs and Wozniak. Page and Brin. Hobbyists dabbling, debating, driving forward. Tinkerers hacking away on nights and weekends.\nWhat seems late is actually early. Now is the time to reimagine what networks can be and what they can do. Software is an un- beatable playground for ingenuity. You don’t have to accept the internet as you found it. You can make something better . . . as a builder, as a creator, as a user, and, most important, as an owner.\nYou are here now. These are the good old days.

        "content": "Snowman is the consensus protocol implemented by the Avalanche blockchain and is part of the Snow family of protocols, first introduced through the original Avalanche leaderless consensus protocol. A major advantage of Snowman is that each consensus decision only requires an expected constant communication overhead per processor in the common case that the protocol is not under substantial Byzantine attack — it provides a solution to the scalability problem which ensures that the expected communication overhead per processor is independent of the total number of processors during normal operation.\nAndrew Lewis-Pye (LSE) discusses recent work with Ava Labs that addresses two issues with the Snowman consensus protocol. He considers a Byzantine adversary that controls substantial processors. First, he provides a simple proof of consistency for Snowman. Then he supplements Snowman with a liveness module that can be triggered in the case that a substantial adversary launches a liveness attack, and which guarantees liveness in this event by temporarily forgoing the communication complexity advantages of Snowman, but without sacrificing these low communication complexity advantages during normal operation.\nAbout the presenter\nAndrew is a mathematician and computer scientist and is a professor at the London School of Economics.

        "content": "Reaching consensus despite faulty or corrupted nodes is a central question in distributed computing; it has received renewed attention over the last years because of its importance for cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks. Modern consensus protocols in this space have relied on a number of different methods for the nodes to influence protocol decisions. Such assumptions include (1) traditional voting, where each node has one vote, (2) weighted voting, where voting power is proportional to stake in an underlying asset, and (3) proof-of-X, which demonstrates a cryptographically verifiable investment of a resource X, such as storage space, time waited, or computational work.

        "content": "Editor’s note: This post originally appeared in our\nnewsletter\n— a guide to trending topics in crypto with insights and resources from engineers, researchers, and others on the a16z crypto team.\nSubscribe\nto see it in your inbox every other week.\nThe election marks a major shift for the industry with many pro-crypto candidates winning office. In this edition, we share thoughts on how the regulatory environment may change post-election; suggestions for U.S. agencies to seize the opportunity; and insights into stablecoins and Ethereum’s future.\nThe path forward, post-election\nMiles Jennings, Michele Korver, and Brian Quintenz\nIn the wake of this election, you’re probably hearing lots of speculation about what will happen to crypto from a regulatory perspective. Most of these takes — and the many yet to come, no doubt — will just be noise.\nThe truth is that it’s too early to tell how everything will shake out. What we do know is that the months ahead will mark a significant shift for the industry and the people working in it.\nWe’re optimistic that the U.S. will now be a better place for crypto builders, and that startups here won’t have to be so focused on merely surviving a hostile regulatory environment. Instead, they can keep working toward all of the exciting progress crypto can make when allowed to thrive with bipartisan support, such as:\ngiving people ownership over their digital identities,\nnew business models for creators,\nlow to no-fee cross-border transactions with stablecoins,\nnew ways for small businesses to engage with their customers,\ndecentralized social networks that empower users,\ndevelopment of physical infrastructure like energy grids,\nblockchains that democratize AI and games,\n…and so much more that we can’t even imagine yet. The future of crypto in the U.S. is bright — it’s the perfect time to build here, and we’re excited about the possibility of regulatory clarity to come.\nRead more\nplus\n: here are a16z cofounders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz on the election’s implications for tech generally and also for crypto in the\nlatest episode\nof their podcast.\n7 things U.S. agencies could do to seize the crypto opportunity\nBrian Quintenz\nImagine if Department of Transportation officials were prohibited from ever getting into a car or riding an airplane. That’s what is happening with the government employees who are tasked with regulating crypto: Right now they’re restricted from using any amount of it, according to a 2022\nlegal advisory notice\nfrom the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.\nWhile it’s obviously important to maintain ethical standards around conflicts of interest, sensible policy comes from engagement with the technology and the knowledge that provides. Government employees charged with regulating crypto should be allowed to use it.\nThis is just one of seven proposals that Brian Quintenz, our head of global policy, recommends government agencies take to help create a functioning regulatory regime for crypto that incentivizes decentralization while protecting consumers. Others include ways to increase efficiency, competition, innovation, and more.\nRead more\nTrend-tracking: Stablecoins\nSam Broner\nMillions of people have transacted trillions of dollars using stablecoins, and yet definitions of the category, and therefore people’s understanding of it, are still fuzzy. To understand the richness and limitations of the stablecoin design space, one useful lens is the history of banking: what worked, what didn’t, and why.\nStablecoins offer users many familiar experiences from bank deposits and bank notes — convenient and reliable store of value, medium of exchange, lending — but in an unbundled, “self-custodiable” form. Like many products in crypto, stablecoins will likely speedrun banking history, starting with simple banknotes before expanding the money supply through increasingly sophisticated lending.\nHere, the author looks at three types of stablecoin tokens, along with their fiat predecessors in the tradfi banking stack, to evaluate how stablecoin adoption could play out.\nRead more\nA deal-maker’s view\nJane Lippencott\nOnchain commerce has been a dominant narrative of 2024, with stablecoin volume ($8.5 trillion in Q2 2024) and market cap (nearly $180 billion today) demonstrating that the need for cheaper, faster, and more transparent payments is a cycle-resistant phenomenon.\na16z crypto State of Crypto Report\n, p.34\nUnderpinning this momentum, 2024 has brought real, institutional-level change. Stripe, SWIFT, and Visa have launched initiatives to use stablecoins natively, greenlighting banks all over the world to partner with crypto wallet providers and start accepting stablecoins on their customers’ behalf. Global regulatory bodies are discussing legislation aimed to clarify rules for onchain payments infrastructure, acknowledging the strategic influence that the first few countries to codify clear guidelines will gain in the ever-changing global financial system.\nThe sheer size of Stripe’s intended acquisition of Bridge — a B2B startup building APIs for stablecoin orchestration — encapsulates the seriousness that global fintechs and banks should be bringing to their boardrooms. When we meet with multinational corporations who are thinking about ways they can meaningfully leverage crypto and web3, the opportunities stablecoins present are consistently at the forefront.\nMore takes on stablecoins…\n💵\nWhat we still don’t know about stablecoins\nStablecoins promise to change the balance of power in long-established industries. Two recent articles from Lightspark Cofounder\nChristian Catalini\n(one with\nJane Wu\n) explore the realities of the stablecoin market. In particular, stablecoin network effects could be weaker than most people anticipate, and competition in the market is far from winner-take-all. While industry insiders often cite liquidity as the primary reason only a few stablecoins will dominate, the truth is more complex. (\nForbes\n/\nHarvard Business Review\n, with Jane Wu)\n🇺🇸\nHow stablecoins can strengthen the U.S. dollar\nStablecoins are typically denominated in dollars and backed by dollar-denominated securities, which is leading crypto in some dollar-friendly directions, writes economist\nTyler Cowen\n. And, as revealed in our\n2024 State of Crypto Report\n, stablecoins have already found product-market fit, as a nearly free, nearly instant payments platform. All of this can concentrate interest in the U.S. dollar and bolster its status as the dominant global currency. (\nBloomberg\n)\nInside Devcon: Glimpsing (possible) Ethereum futures\nNoah Citron\nAt Devcon this past Tuesday,\nJustin Drake\nof the Ethereum Foundation\nrevealed his vision\nfor Ethereum’s future: the “beam” chain. Beam would be an overhaul of Ethereum’s consensus layer, inspired by lessons from building the beacon chain, the backbone of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system.\nBeam would be designed to improve staking economics, increase decentralization, add single slot finality, reduce block times, migrate to post-quantum cryptography, and use zkVMs to make validators more performant. Work on beam would continue alongside the existing beacon chain, with the goal of switching to beam around 2029.\nBeam also represents an opportunity to onboard additional core development teams, Drake said, announcing plans to build beam clients both in Asia and South America. Drake emphasized that this is just his vision for Ethereum, but he hopes to gain alignment within the Ethereum community over the coming months.\nWatch the talk\n…\nrawr\n—\na16z crypto editorial, research, and engineering teams\n***\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

        "title": "A useful framework for understanding stablecoins: Banking history",
        "url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/understanding-stablecoins-banking-history/",
        "content": "Millions of people have transacted trillions of dollars using stablecoins — and yet definitions of the category, and therefore people’s understanding of it, remain fuzzy.\nStablecoins are stores of value and media of exchange, usually — but not necessarily — pegged to the dollar. They have been described as existing on two axes: from under- to over-collateralized, and from centralized to decentralized. This is useful, especially in helping people understand how technical structure\nrelates to risk\nand in combating misconceptions about stablecoins. I’ll build on that framework by offering another instructive way to think about them.\nIf we want to understand the richness — and limitations — of the stablecoin design space, one useful lens is the history of banking: what worked, what didn’t, and why. Like many products in crypto, stablecoins will likely speedrun banking history, starting with simple banknotes before expanding the money supply through increasingly sophisticated lending.\nFirst, I’ll consider the recent history of stablecoins, then take you through some banking history to be able to draw out useful comparisons between stablecoins and the banking stack. Stablecoins offer users many familiar experiences from bank deposits and bank notes — convenient and reliable store of value, medium of exchange, lending — but in an unbundled, “self-custodiable” form factor. Along the way, I’ll evaluate three kinds of tokens: fiat-backed stablecoins, asset-backed stablecoins, and strategy-backed synthetic dollars.\nLet’s dive in.\nSome recent stablecoin history\nThe years since\nUSDC\n— the most widely adopted US-based stablecoin — launched in 2018 have produced enough evidence to show what has and hasn’t worked, so it’s time to clearly delineate the landscape. Early adopters use fiat-backed stablecoins to transfer and save money. Decentralized-overcollateralized lending protocols produce stablecoins that are useful and reliable, but have seen flat demand. Consumers so far seem to strongly prefer dollar-denominated stablecoins over other (fiat or novel) denominations.\nSome categories of stablecoins have outright failed. Decentralized-undercollateralized stablecoins are more capital efficient than fiat-backed or overcollateralized stablecoins, but the highest profile examples have ended in catastrophe. Others categories have yet to materialize: Yield-bearing stablecoins are intuitively exciting — who doesn’t like yield? — but face user experience and regulatory hurdles.\nOther kinds of dollar-denominated tokens have also emerged, piggybacking on the successful\nproduct-market fit\nof stablecoins.\nStrategy-backed synthetic dollars\n(described in more detail below) are a new product category that has not yet been properly described, similar to stablecoins but not actually meeting important standards for safety and maturity, with riskier yield adopted as investments by DeFi enthusiasts.\nWe’ve also witnessed the rapid adoption of\nfiat-backed stablecoins\n, attractive because of their simplicity and perceived safety; the lagging adoption of\nasset-backed stablecoins\n, traditionally the largest share of deposit investments. Analyzing stablecoins through the lens of the traditional banking stack helps explain these trends.\nBank deposits and American money: A little history\nTo understand how contemporary stablecoins mimic the banking stack, it’s useful to understand the history of banking in the United States. Before the Federal Reserve Act (1913) and especially before the National Banking Acts (1863 –1864), different types of dollars were not treated equally. (For those interested in\nlearning more\n, the United States had three central banking eras prior to a national currency: The Central Banking Eras [First Bank 1791–1811 and Second Bank 1816–1836], the Free Banking Era [1837–1863], and the National Banking Era [1863–1913]. We’ve tried everything.)\nPrior to establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933, deposits had to be specifically underwritten against banking risk. Bank notes (cash), deposits, and checks could have very different “real” values depending on three factors: who issued them, the ease of redemption, and the perceived reliability of the issuer.\nWhy? Because of a tension banks faced (and still face) between making money and keeping deposits safe.\nTo make money, banks need to invest deposits and take on risk, but to keep deposits safe banks need to manage risk and have cash on hand. Before the mid-to-late 1800s, people judged different forms of money as having different levels of risk — and hence different real values. After the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, a dollar became a dollar (for the most part).\nToday, banks use dollar deposits to buy treasuries and equities, make loans, and participate in simple strategies like market making or hedging as permitted by the Volcker Rule, which was introduced in 2008 to reduce insolvency risk by decreasing speculation at retail banks. Lending is a particularly important part of banking and is how banks increase money supply and capital efficiency in the economy.\nWhile retail banking customers might think of all of their money sitting in their deposit accounts, this is not the case. Yet because of federal oversight, consumer protections, broad adoption, and improved risk management, consumers can treat deposits as a unified balance that is relatively risk free. Banks are balancing money-making and risk in the background, while users are mostly ignorant of exactly what banks are doing with their deposits, but largely assured of\ndeposit safety\neven during instability.\nStablecoins offer users many familiar experiences from bank deposits and bank notes — convenient and reliable store of value, medium of exchange, lending — but in an unbundled, “self-custodiable” form factor. Stablecoins will follow their fiat predecessors. Adoption will start with simple banknotes, but as decentralized lending protocols mature, asset backed stablecoins will grow in popularity.\nStablecoins through the lens of bank deposits\nWith that background, we can evaluate the three types of stablecoins — fiat-backed stablecoins, asset-backed stablecoins, and strategy-backed synthetic dollars — through the lens of retail banking.\nFiat-backed stablecoins\nFiat-backed stablecoins\nare similar to U.S. bank notes from the National Banking Era (1865–1913). In this period, bank notes were\nbearer instruments\nissued by banks; federal regulation required customers could redeem them for equivalent\ngreenbacks\n(e.g., special U.S. Treasuries) or other legal tender (“\nspecie\n”). So while the value of the bank notes could vary depending on the issuer’s reputation, proximity, and perceived solvency, most people trusted bank notes.\nFiat-backed stablecoins operate under the same principle. They are tokens that users can directly redeem for a well-understood, trusted fiat currency — with a similar caveat: While banknotes were a bearer instrument that anyone could redeem, the holder might not live close to the issuing bank. Over time, people accepted that they could find someone to trade with who could then redeem their banknote for a greenback or specie. Similarly, fiat-backed stablecoin users have grown confident that they can use Uniswap, Coinbase, or other exchanges to reliably find someone who values high quality fiat-backed stablecoins at a dollar.\nToday, a combination of regulatory pressure and user preference seems to be drawing more and more users toward fiat-backed stablecoins, which constitute over 94% of the total stablecoin supply. Two companies, Circle and Tether, dominate fiat-backed stablecoins issuance, together issuing over $150B in dollar-dominated fiat-backed stablecoins.\nBut why should users trust fiat-backed stablecoins issuers? After all, fiat-backed stablecoins are centrally issued, and it’s easy to imagine a “bank run” of stablecoin redemptions. To counter these risks, fiat-backed stablecoins benefit from being audited by reputable accounting firms. For instance, Circle undergoes regular audits from Deloitte. These audits are designed to ensure that stablecoin issuers have enough fiat currency or short-term treasuries in reserve to cover any near-term redemptions and that the issuer has enough total fiat collateral to support back every stablecoin 1:1.\nVerifiable proof of reserve and decentralized issuance of fiat stablecoins or verifiable proof of reserves are both possible, but not yet implemented.\nVerifiable proof of reserve\nwould improve auditability and is possible today through\nzkTLS\n(zero knowledge transport layer security, also known as web proofs) and similar means, although it still relies on trusted centralized authority.\nDecentralized issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins\nmay be possible, but substantial regulatory issues stand in the way. For instance, to issue decentralized fiat-backed stablecoins, issuers would need to hold U.S. treasuries onchain with a similar risk profile to traditional treasuries. That isn’t possible today, but it would make it even easier for users to trust fiat backed stablecoins.\nAsset-backed stablecoins\nAsset-backed stablecoins\nare the product of onchain loans. They mimic how banks create new money through lending. Decentralized overcollateralized lending protocols like the Sky Protocol (formerly MakerDAO) issue new stablecoins that are backed by onchain, highly liquid collateral.\nTo understand how this works, consider a checking account. The money in your checking account is part of a complicated system of lending, regulation, and risk management that creates new money. In fact, the majority of the money in circulation,\nthe so-called M2 money supply\n, is created by banks through lending. While banks use mortgages, auto loans, business loans, inventory financing, and more to create money, lending protocols use onchain tokens as loan collateral thereby creating asset-backed stablecoins.\nThe system that enables loans to create new money is called\nfractional reserve banking\n, which started in earnest with the Federal Reserve Banking Act of 1913. Fractional reserve banking has matured significantly since then with major updates in 1933 (with the establishment of the FDIC), in 1971 (when President Nixon ended the gold standard), and in 2020 (when reserve requirement ratios were reduced to zero).\nWith each change consumers and regulators became more confident in the systems that create new money through lending. Over 110 years, lending has created a larger and larger portion, now a larger majority, of the U.S. money supply.\nThere’s a good reason consumers don’t consider all this lending every time they use a dollar. First, money stored in bank deposits is protected by federal deposit insurance. Second, despite major crises like those in 1929 and 2008, banks and regulators have steadily improved their practices and processes to reduce risk.\nTraditional financial institutions have used three methods to safely issue a loan:\nagainst an asset with liquid markets and quick liquidation practices (margin loans)\nusing large scale statistical analysis over a bundled set of loans (mortgages)\nwith thoughtful and bespoke underwriting (business loans)\nDecentralized lending protocols still only make up a small portion of the stablecoin supply because they are at the very beginning of this journey.\nThe most prominent decentralized overcollateralized lending protocols are transparent, well tested, and conservative. For example, Sky, the most prominent collateralized lending protocol, issues asset-backed stablecoins against assets that are: onchain, exogenous, low volatility, and highly liquid (easily sellable). Sky also has strict rules about collateralization ratios as well as effective governance and auction protocols. These properties make sure that even with changing conditions, collateral can be safely sold, protecting the redemption value of the asset-backed stablecoin.\nUsers can evaluate collateralized lending protocols against four criteria:\ntransparency of governance\nratio, quality, and volatility of assets backing the stablecoin\nsecurity of smart contracts\nability to maintain loan collateralization ratio in real time\nAs with the example of money in a checking account, asset-backed stablecoins are new money created through asset-backed loans, but with vastly more transparent, auditable, and understandable lending practices. Users can audit the collateral underlying asset-backed stablecoins, but can only trust bank executives’ investment decisions with their deposits.\nFurther, the decentralization and transparency that blockchains enable can mitigate the risks that securities laws are intended to address. This is important for stablecoins because it means that truly decentralized asset-backed stablecoins are potentially\noutside the scope of securities laws\n— an analysis that may be limited to asset-backed stablecoins that rely exclusively on digitally native collateral (as opposed to “real-world assets”). This is because such collateral can be safeguarded with autonomous protocols, as opposed to centralized intermediaries.\nAs more of the economy moves onchain, expect two things: first, for more assets to be candidates for the collateral used in lending protocols; and second, for asset-backed stablecoins to be a larger portion of onchain money. Other types of loans will likely eventually be safely issued onchain to further extend the onchain money supply. With that said, just because users can evaluate asset-backed stablecoins does not mean every user will want to take on that responsibility.\nJust as it has taken time for traditional bank lending to grow, regulators to lower reserve requirements, and lending practices to mature, it will take time for onchain lending protocols to mature. So it will be a while before more people can easily transact with asset-backed stablecoins as readily as we can transact with fiat-backed stablecoins.\nStrategy-backed synthetic dollars\nRecently, some projects have been offering $1-denominated tokens that represent a combination of collateral and an investment strategy. These tokens are often lumped in with stablecoins, but strategy-backed synthetic dollars should not be considered stablecoins. Here’s why.\nStrategy-backed synthetic dollars\n(SBSDs) expose users directly to actively managed trading risk. They are typically centralized, undercollateralized tokens layered with financial derivatives. More accurately, SBSDs are dollar shares in an open-ended hedge fund — a structure that is both difficult to audit and that could expose users to centralized exchange (CEX) risk and asset price volatility, if, for instance, there were significant market movements or a persistent downward sentiment.\nThese attributes make SBSDs a poor choice for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange, which are the main purpose of stablecoins. While SBSDs can be constructed in many ways, with varying levels of risk and stability, all of them offer a dollar-denominated financial product that people may want in their investment portfolios.\nSBSDs can be built on many strategies — for instance, the\nbasis trade\nor participation in  yield-generating protocols like the restaking protocols that help secure actively validated services (\nAVSs\n)\n. These projects manage risk and reward, typically allowing users to earn yield on top of a cash position. By managing risk with earnings, including by evaluating AVSs for slashing risk, seeking higher yield opportunities, or monitoring the basis trade for inversion, projects can produce a yield-bearing SBSD.\nUsers should deeply understand the risks and mechanisms of any SBSD before using it (as with any novel instrument). DeFi users should also consider the consequences of using SBSDs in DeFi strategies due to the substantial cascading consequences of a depeg. When an asset depegs, or suddenly loses value relative to its tracking asset, derivatives that rely on price stability and consistent yield can destabilize suddenly. But underwriting the risk of any given strategy can be hard or impossible when the strategy includes centralized, closed source, or unauditable components. You have to know what you’re underwriting to underwrite it.\nWhile banks do run simple strategies with bank deposits, they’re actively managed and a\nde minimis\npart of the overall capital allocation. It’s hard to use these strategies to back stablecoins because they must be actively managed, which makes those strategies hard to reliably decentralize or audit. SBSDs expose users to more concentrated risk than banks allow in deposits. Users would be right to be skeptical if their deposits were held in such a vehicle.\nIn fact, users have been wary of SBSDs. Despite their popularity among risk-favoring users, few users are transacting with them. Further, the U.S. SEC has brought\nenforcement\nactions\nagainst issuers of “stablecoins” that functioned like shares in investment funds.\n***\nStablecoins have arrived. There are over $160B of stablecoins used in transactions around the globe. They’ve settled into two major categories: fiat-backed stablecoins and asset-backed stablecoins. Other dollar-denominated tokens, like strategy-backed synthetic dollars, have grown in mindshare, but don’t fit the definition of a stablecoin as fit for transaction or storing value.\nBanking history is a great proxy for understanding the category — stablecoins must first consolidate around a clear, understandable, and trivially redeemable bank note, similar to how federal reserve banknotes won over mindshare in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Over time, we should expect asset-backed stablecoins, issued by decentralized overcollateralized lenders, to increase in volume, just as the M2 money supply has been increased by banks lending on deposits. And lastly, we should expect DeFi to continue to grow, both by creating more SBSDs for investors and by increasing the quality and quantity of asset-backed stablecoins.\nBut this analysis — as useful as it might be — only takes us so far. Stablecoins are already the cheapest way to send a dollar, meaning that real opportunities exist for stablecoins to reset the market structure in the payments industry, creating opportunities for incumbents and, even more importantly, for startups to build on a new platform of frictionless and cost-free payments.\n***\nAcknowledgements: Special thanks to Eddy Lazzarin, Tim Sullivan, Aiden Slavin, Robert Hackett, Michael Blau, Miles Jennings, and Scott Kominers for their thoughtful feedback and suggestions that made this post possible.\n***\nSam Broner\nis a partner on the investing team at a16z crypto.

        "content": "In April, the a16z crypto research and engineering teams released an initial implementation of\nJolt\n, a state-of-the-art zkVM. Since then, the Jolt team and open source contributors have made several improvements to Jolt’s performance and usability.\nThe upshot for performance is that Jolt’s verifier costs have come way down: from proof sizes that were well into the MBs in April, to about 200 KBs today. Further reductions down to 25 KBs are possible.\nJolt’s reduced verifier costs will pay further dividends in the coming months, unlocking efficient\nfolding\nschemes\nto control prover space. Integrating folding into Jolt will yield three major features all at once. Folding will\nkeep the prover’s space to just a few GB,\nachieve zero-knowledge, and\nyield on-chain proofs.\nSeparately, the Jolt prover is poised to speed up by roughly a factor of up to 3. This improvement will come from\nincorporating\nrecently-identified\noptimizations\nto the sum-check protocol, and\nbetter leveraging\nof the highly uniform nature of the constraint system arising in Jolt.\nA short video overview of the Jolt roadmap and vision is\nhere\n. Details of the improvements completed since April are below.\nRust standard library support\nOn release, Jolt only supported guest programs written in “no-std” Rust. Engineering partner\nNoah Citron\nintegrated support for the Rust standard library, enabling developers to use many more existing Rust crates off-the-shelf.\nRISC-V “M” extension\nWith help from open source contributors\nMihir Wadekar\nand\nEthan Lee\n, we added support for the RISC-V “M” extension for integer multiplication and division. This significantly improved Jolt’s performance on guest programs using many multiplications or divisions, which previously would be compiled to lengthy instruction sequences.\nSupport for new commitment schemes\nThe initial implementation of Jolt used Hyrax as its polynomial commitment scheme, though the Jolt architecture is compatible with any multilinear commitment scheme. While Hyrax provided good prover performance, its proofs were relatively large. Open source contributors\nPat Stiles\nand\nEthan Lee\nintegrated the\nZeromorph\nand\nHyperKZG\npolynomial commitment schemes, respectively, both of which significantly reduce proof sizes with only a modest prover slowdown.\nSmaller opening proofs\nWe implemented a sum-check-based protocol (originally implemented in\nNova\n) to reduce multiple opening proofs to one. This reduces proof size and, for some polynomial commitment schemes, reduces prover time as well.\n“Quarks” grand products\nOpen source contributor\nalpeh_v\nimplemented the grand product argument described in the Quarks\npaper\nas an alternative to Jolt’s existing implementation of\nThaler ‘13\ngrand products. Compared to Thaler ‘13, the Quarks grand product argument yields smaller proofs at the cost of prover time.\nProgress towards on-chain verification\nAlpeh_v\nand\nMatteo Mer\nalso made significant progress toward a Solidity implementation of the Jolt verifier. Once completed, this will allow Jolt proofs to be verified on any EVM blockchain.\nAVX-512 library for field arithmetic\nWe worked with Dag Arne Osvik to release an\nAVX-512 library\nfor 256-bit Montgomery arithmetic. This can be used to accelerate field arithmetic in Jolt, Groth16, and other elliptic curve-based SNARKs on hardware that supports the extension. A full integration of this library into Jolt will come in the future.\nOngoing formal verification efforts\nLed by Quang Dao and Carl Kwan, interns in our summer research program, formal verification efforts have taken on four tasks so far:\nBuilding and validating a formal model of RISC-V in ACL2\nVerifying that the “evaluation table decompositions” in Jolt are all correct (i.e., verifying the way we break each primitive instruction into lookups into “subtables” and collate the results into the instruction’s output)\nConfirming that the “R1CS constraints and lookups” in Jolt together in fact capture correct RISC-V semantics\nFormalizing in Lean the completeness and soundness of the Jolt polynomial IOP, starting with two of its key components: Lasso and Spartan\nThe first two tasks are complete, the third is nearly so, and the fourth is in progress. These efforts have already led to the identification of minor bugs and optimizations in the Jolt implementation.\nComing soon\nOur work is far from finished. We are working with several teams and individual contributors to advance Jolt, and we have several exciting improvements underway, including:\nVarious sum-check prover optimizations\nFurther reduction in proof size and verifier costs\nGPU integration\nContinuations via folding (i.e., integration of Jolt with Nova).\nIntegration of the Binius commitment scheme and a switch from 256-bit prime-order fields to binary fields are further out.\nIf you’d like to contribute or learn more about Jolt’s\nroadmap\n, reach out to\n@moodlezoup\n.\n***\nJustin Thaler\nis Research Partner at a16z and an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University.

        "url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/ethereum-roadmap-focil-and-multi-proposers/",
        "content": "Ethereum now supports a vibrant ecosystem of applications and Layer 2s. But its transaction supply chain, which determines which transactions land onchain, enshrines certain participants with market power, harming the chain’s economic efficiency.\nMany issues with Ethereum’s transaction supply chain stem from the fact that for every slot, a single proposer has monopoly control over what transactions to include in their block. Proposers also have incentives offchain and from the application layer that affect their behavior. These sometimes competing incentives make it difficult to encourage proposers to\nhonestly follow the protocol\n.\nTwo types of proposer deviations are of particular concern: (1) short-term censorship, and (2) acting on enshrined latency advantages.\nHow to prioritize and address these two problems depends on Ethereum’s development roadmap. If Ethereum has to solve short-term censorship resistance, constrained single proposer designs have appealing properties while also being close to well specified enough with proposals like\nFOCIL\nto be implemented. But if Ethereum’s success also relies on addressing some of the negative market effects of single proposer schemes on the application layer, more drastic change likely needs to happen.\nMulti-proposer schemes\nlook promising to address the broader concerns.\nThe rest of this post describes these problems in more detail before getting into how these issues impact Ethereum’s functionality. I’ll then analyze the two potential solutions to address them — the implementation of which depends on Ethereum’s roadmap.\nProblem 1: Short-term censorship\nBlockchains inherent censorship resistance from liveness: Eventually every valid submitted transaction will make it onchain. But the bounds on how long a transaction will take to be included onchain are too loose for many applications. DeFi transactions are a common example, where it might be only a few seconds until a transaction is stale. In these scenarios, a proposer could stand to gain by censoring a transaction even for a single block, degrading the efficiency of these applications.\nConsider the\ncase\nwhere a dapp wants to sell an item every slot via a first price auction. Assume this item has a common value of $10; thus in a competitive auction we’d expect the dapp to receive around $10. But since the auction takes place over the course of a slot, all the bids from the auction need to be included by the proposer. In a single proposer scheme, the proposer could simply exclude others’ bids, and include only their own low bid, winning the item for much less than the item is worth.\nSuch instances require a notion of\nshort-term censorship resistance\nthat captures how hard it is for an adversary to censor a transaction for a single block. Short-term censorship resistance is an economic property. If more transactions demand to be included in a block than there is space, some of the transactions must be left out. Those transactions aren’t necessarily being censored by an adversary; rather, they are simply priced out of inclusion. However, some protocols make it easier for an adversary to either price out or incentivize the proposer not to include target transactions. In the spirit of saying protocol A is\nmore\ncensorship resistant than protocol B if it is more difficult for an adversary to censor a target transaction in A than B, we use the following definition:\nProtocol A is more short-term censorship resistant than protocol B if all else equal, for any transaction t, the minimum net payments an adversary has to make to prevent t from being included at equilibrium in a given block is higher under A than B.\n(This definition is intentionally not well defined mathematically. Formally defining the game being played and the equilibrium concept will be the subject of future work. For now, the examples convey the spirit of this definition.)\nExample\nWith Ethereum using\nEIP-1559\nas its fee mechanism, an adversary simply needs to pay the proposer more than a transaction’s tip above the base fee to not include it.\nIf the fee mechanism is a first-price auction, an adversary would have to pay the proposer more than the entirety of a user’s bid to incentivize them to not include the transaction.\nNote that bidders are expected to only pay tiny tips under EIP-1559. Thus while the bids under a first price auction are expected to be relatively small in comparison to a transaction’s true value, they are still substantially higher than what the transaction’s tip would be in EIP-1559. Thus we would say that Ethereum using a first price auction as its TFM is\nmore\nshort-term censorship resistant than Ethereum using EIP-1559. In either case, however, if the equilibrium price for inclusion for a Defi transaction is high enough to deter an adversary, users now have to pay a hefty tax to the protocol in turn making the Defi app itself less attractive.\nProblem 2: Enshrined proposer latency advantages\nIn a single proposer architecture, the proposer is by design the last one to move in the block production game for a given slot. (In practice there is a complicated offchain transaction supply chain where relays move last. For the purposes of this post we treat proposers and builders as combined.) This means that proposers can always submit transactions that reflect a “fresher” state compared to any other submitted transactions. Even if both users and the proposer receive information simultaneously, it takes time for users to send their transactions to the proposer, during which new information might arrive. The proposer is in a position to instantly react to this information and potentially change their transaction, but the user has no time to do this.\nFor example, the optimal way to route a trade onchain may depend on the offchain ETH-USD price on Binance. In a single proposer architecture, a sophisticated proposer can submit trades that are more up-to-date than any users competing for the same trade.\nExample\nConsider our previous example of a dapp selling an item every slot via first-price auction. But now the item’s value is a function of constantly updating information. Assume there are two bidders competing for the item, agents 1 and 2. Both agents hear new information simultaneously, except agent 1 always gets to bid after agent 2. In this case, agent 2 is adversely selected against when they win because the only time bidder 2 wins is when the information updates after they submit their bid to the point that they are over paying. Otherwise, whenever the information changes so that bidder 2’s bid is profitable, bidder 1 will simply update their bid in response to the newer information and win the auction. This effect is especially stark when agent 1 can directly observe agent 2’s bid, but even if agent 1 can’t see agent 2’s bid, agent 1 still has a substantial competitive advantage. In the long run, agent 2 will not find it worth it to participate, letting agent 1 capture all the value from the auction.\nThis example shows how structural advantages given to the proposer can cause competition to dry up and drive all the surplus value from onchain markets to the proposer.\nPossible solutions depend on the roadmap\nThe extent to which short-term censorship resistance and proposer latency advantages matter depend on the Ethereum development roadmap. One vision for Ethereum’s future is fully embracing the L2 roadmap and having all meaningful execution happen offchain, with Ethereum being used for settlement, data availability, and proof-verification. In such a world, short-term censorship is the main problem, although achieving it over the span of ~10 blocks may be sufficient rather than the block-level guarantees we described above. An alternative path is for Ethereum to serve as a hub for high value execution, and in particular for high-value Defi. In this world, achieving strong short-term censorship resistance and alleviating proposers’ strong structural economic advantages becomes essential.\nTwo alternatives help address these problems. The first is a\nconstrained single proposer architecture\nthat adds committees which bind the proposer’s action space. The second is a\nmulti-proposer architecture\nthat looks dramatically different from Ethereum’s current design: It splits the proposer’s power among many different parties.\nWhile both designs are still in active development, there have been proposals of what these architectures might look like. We outline what these proposals look like and analyze how they address the problems we’ve discussed.\nA case for FOCIL\nConstrained single proposer architecture\nA constrained single proposer architecture is one where a committee within the same block imposes constraints on the proposer. Inclusion lists (ILs) are the most natural example of this, where an inclusion committee enforces that a block proposer include certain transactions the committee hears about.\nThe amount of power the committee has varies in different designs. One important distinction is between unconditional and conditional inclusion lists. With unconditional inclusion lists, the transactions the committee includes must be included by a proposer for the block to be valid. With conditional inclusion lists, a block only has to include the contents of the inclusion list conditioned on the block not being full, meaning that if the proposer fills the entire block with their own transactions, they aren’t required to include any transactions in the inclusion list. While unconditional ILs can offer better short-term censorship resistance, they might also be easier to crowd out because they might be used to offer products like preconfirmations.\nThe latest proposal for a constrained single proposer design on Ethereum is called FOCIL (fork choice conditional inclusion lists), which lays out how to implement inclusion lists (FOCIL is not explicitly designed to deal with high-value MEV transactions but is instead optimized for censorship resistance over the span of a few blocks. Nevertheless, as it’s the most concrete specification of what a constrained-single proposer architecture could look like, it’s useful to analyze it in this setting.)\nThe high-level design is as follows (for details, see “\nFOCIL CL & EL workflow\n”): Every slot a subset of validators are chosen as inclusion committee members. Committee members construct their lists of transactions up to a local IL size limit (in KB). These lists are locked ¾ of the way through the slot and gossiped to the proposer, who is then responsible for appending any transactions they are missing in the list to their block, until their block hits the gas limit. Then, in addition to standard block validity rules, attesters also check that proposed blocks are conformant against the corresponding inclusion lists. Note, there are no economic incentives in the protocol for the inclusion list committee to act honestly.\nAnalysis\nShort-term censorship resistance\nThe short-term censorship resistance of a constrained single proposer scheme depends on what types of constraints are allowed and how the proposer is bound to them. As we define short-term censorship via an economic model, the details of how the inclusion committee is incentivized can also change the relative power of these mechanisms. We will start by analyzing FOCIL with EIP-1559 as the L1 TFM before expanding on what is possible in the space of constrained single proposer mechanisms.\nSince FOCIL does not explicitly incentivize the inclusion committee to include any transactions, let’s assume that the inclusion list committee is non-strategic and acts honestly. FOCIL also doesn’t specify what inclusion rule honest IL committee members should follow, but for our analysis we assume that honest IL members will include transactions they hear about with the highest priority fees. (FOCIL’s goal is to also increase censorship resistance on longer time scales than a slot, so the intention is that some committee members also follow inclusion rules such as including transactions that have been in the mempool the longest.)\nNow consider an instance where an adversary is targeting a transaction that tips $10 on top of the base fee, and that $10 is sufficiently high to make the transaction included in the IL. The adversary here has two options. They can either send enough transactions above a $10 tip in the mempool to kick the target transaction out of the IL while also bribing the proposer $10 to not include the target; or the adversary could send enough transactions to fill the proposer’s block and also still send the proposer with $10 to not include the target transaction. Either of these strategies is significantly more expensive for the adversary than the status quo of only paying the proposer $10 to not include the target transaction. In the former case, the adversary has to pay the priority fee plus base fee for any of the transactions that ends up landing on chain; in the later case the adversary has to pay at least the base fee to fill the entire block (assuming EIP-1559 as the base layer TFM).\nIf FOCIL instead used unconditional inclusion lists, the second attack vector would be ruled out. Thus, if the target transaction had a high tip, then the adversary would be put in the position of filling the IL gas limit with transactions having tips above the target, which is potentially much more expensive than paying the base fee to fill the entire block.\nThe key assumption in this analysis is that the IL committee acts honestly while being non-strategic. If the inclusion committee were strategic, then the adversary could pay them an arbitrarily small amount to produce empty lists in the current protocol. Without any mechanism incentivizing the IL committee to follow the protocol, analyzing the short-term censorship resistance of these protocols reduces to the standard single proposer case. Fee mechanism design that allows fees of transactions included by the IL committee to go to the IL committee can help increase the robustness of these protocols, but the details of such designs and the properties they would satisfy are the subject of future work (for instance, see\nthis example\n).\nProposer latency advantage\nConstraints like ILs alone don’t help address proposers’ latency advantages. In these designs, the single proposer still moves last and still has the power to insert whatever transactions they like. In general, the constrained single proposer setting has difficulty addressing this problem because any form of a constraint committee must act before the end of a slot for the proposer to have time to hear the outcome of the constraint and act accordingly. Thus, the proposer has the privileged position to act on any information that arrives in this duration. The only way around this is for a committee, rather than the proposer, to end the block production game, in which case we move toward a multi-proposer architecture.\nA case for multi-proposer\nMulti-proposer architecture\nA multi-proposer architecture explicitly has multiple proposers jointly building a block every slot. Many potential instantions exist, but multi-proposer schemes generally have a similar structure: A set of validators is chosen randomly by stake as proposers in a given slot. At the end of the slot, each chosen validator proposes a set of transactions following a local block validity rule. Then the protocol deterministically aggregates these proposals into a single canonical block.\nThe key feature of multi-proposer schemes is that no single proposer is given special power over what gets included in a block. Even though the multiple proposers in such a scheme have advantages compared to non-proposers, the competition between proposers themselves can lead to improved market equilibria.\nAs opposed to the constrained single proposer setting that is additive to the current Ethereum protocol, a multi-proposer architecture would require a fundamental rework of Ethereum. As such, many components have to be reasoned about, including the transaction supply chain, consensus, and fee mechanisms. Here, we will consider an idealized model of a multi-proposer architecture where the consensus details are worked out and we can focus on a single slot in isolation. Assumptions include that all the proposers are homogenous and have equal access to information, and that the aggregation rule is simply taking a union over all proposed transactions. (This analysis holds for any reasonable choice of ordering rule.) A large part of bringing multi-proposer to production will be relaxing these assumptions to create a full specification, but even with this simple model there is still much to consider.\nAnalysis\nShort-term censorship resistance\nThe short-term censorship resistance of a multi-proposer architecture depends on the TFM being used. For example, schemes that evenly distribute fees across all proposers and are pay-as-bid for users can incentivize better throughput but worse short-term censorship resistance than you would get from current single proposer schemes. On the other hand, some proposal TFMs look to take advantage of multi-proposer architectures to get more censorship resistance than would be possible in a single proposal scheme.\nFor example,\nFox, Pai, and Resnick.\nmake the observation that having a transaction’s payment be a function of how many proposers include a transaction can drastically increase the cost to censor the transaction. Their TFM has users submit a pair of bids\n(t,T)\nwith\nt<<T\n. If\nk>1\nproposers include the transaction. The transaction pays\nkt\nwith\nt\ngoing to each of the corresponding proposers. However, if only one proposer includes the transaction, then the transaction pays\nT\nto the single block producer. Hence, an adversary has to pay\nkT\nto censor the transaction, since any validator can unilaterally deviate to include the transaction if no one else is, while the transaction only expects to pay\nΘ(t)\nfor inclusion.\nThis gap between how much a transaction has to pay for inclusion and the cost to censor it, is a key property that comes from proposers competing among themselves. A censoring adversary needs to make payments such that\nnone\nof the proposers include the transaction. Of course, if the proposers all collude, this analysis breaks down and the benefits of multi-proposer is lost — potentially leaving us in a worse situation than the single proposer case. However, as the number of concurrent proposers increases, both the amount an adversary has to pay to induce a censoring equilibrium and the difficulty of maintaining the collusion increase since even one proposer deviating from the censoring ring would be sufficient to regain short-term censorship resistance properties.\nProposer latency advantage\nAssume no proposer can see other proposers’ blocks before they make their own block. Perfect synchrony could achieve this, but, more practically, cryptography can achieve the same end. Proposers can use time lock encryption to have their block contents hidden only for a few seconds. Thus, if proposers all release their blocks a couple seconds before the end of the slot, proposers can’t see each other’s blocks until the slot has passed. Instead of time lock encryption we could also threshold encrypt block contents to an attester committee to achieve a similar property.\nGiven this assumption, there is no party who moves last to end the block production game. This means that proposers are forced to compete with one another on an equal playing field to take advantage of opportunities at the application layer.  As new information comes in, all proposers are in an equal position to react and update their transactions. This competition then keeps this value within the application layer and allows a competitive market to exist instead of having the market unravel and letting the value all leak to a single proposer. Note, however, that a multi-proposer scheme doesn’t change the structural advantage proposers have over users, since users still face a latency delay in getting their transactions to the proposer. But now instead of a single party with the advantage, there are multiple parties with equal advantages.\nThe exact details of how to implement the cryptography so proposers can’t see each others’ blocks before they propose their own are crucial to maintaining this property. Otherwise, certain proposers again have structural market advantages over others, degrading the competitiveness of onchain markets. These specifications are still largely works in progress.\n***\nIf the main concern Ethereum has to solve is short-term censorship resistance, constrained single proposer designs have appealing properties while also being close to well specified enough with proposals like FOCIL to be implemented. On the other hand, if Ethereum’s success also relies on addressing some of the negative market effects of single proposer schemes on the application layer, more drastic change is likely needed. Multi-proposer schemes look promising to address the broader space of issues. But since these designs completely restructure the Ethereum stack, they have a longer path ahead of them in getting to a complete specification and addressing all the potential second-order effects of such large changes.\n***\nAcknowledgments: Thanks to Barnabe, Joachim, Julian, Max, and Thomas for helpful comments and suggestions\n***\nPranav Garimidi\nis a research analyst at a16z crypto.

We have told them that we have an incredible opportunity to build on the bipartisan progress from the last Congress and bring the best of crypto to the world.\nOver the next few months, expect to hear a range of speculation and “hot takes” about what will happen from a legislative and regulatory perspective – the vast majority of it will just be noise. The truth is that it’s too early to tell how everything will shake out, but what we do know is that it is significant for the industry. We’re very optimistic that the government will now foster innovation, accelerate progress, and enable the crypto ecosystem to thrive in the U.S.\nThis will enable a future where we can deliver on the many consumer benefits that we’ve been excited about: giving people ownership over their digital identities,\nnew business models for creatives\n, low to no-fee cross border transactions with stablecoins, new ways for small businesses like restaurants to engage with their customers, the emergence of decentralized social networks, development of physical infrastructure like energy grids, as well as blockchains democratizing AI and games, and so much more that we can’t even imagine yet.\nThe good news is that there is now a pathway for constructive engagement with regulatory agencies and legislation that can bring regulatory clarity. You should now all feel empowered to explore all of the groundbreaking products and services that blockchains enable, including tokens. While we’ll likely have greater flexibility to experiment, we can’t forget that the fundamental regulatory principles applicable to blockchain systems remain unchanged. This means that “where there is trust, there is regulation” still applies. So, you should continue to focus on removing centralized aspects or dependencies on trust within your projects, as these are the areas that continue to attract regulatory scrutiny.\nNext year, we’ll advocate for clear regulatory frameworks that foster and bolster innovation and decentralization. This is both an opportunity and a responsibility for builders – you can actively shape this future by developing projects that demonstrate how decentralized protocols eliminate risks and justify new regulatory approaches.\nThis will provide well-meaning entrepreneurs with a pathway to decentralization, while also protecting consumers by making sure scams and frauds are caught early.\nThere will still be\nvalid scrutiny from regulators and policymakers of certain aspects of the industry irrespective of progress on new legislation or a re-calibrated regulatory environment.\nThis is particularly true for token issuances, where the principles-based guidance in our\nToken Launch Playbook\nstill applies.\nWe should expect a future where these clear rules\nwill make it easier to identify and shut down bad actors, similar to FTX, while allowing well meaning projects to take off. This will both protect consumers and rebuild trust and confidence in the technology. The previous approach of regulation by enforcement, with no regulatory clarity, both blocked good actors and allowed bad actors, which actively harmed consumers and unfairly eroded trust in the space.\nHowever, for many of you who have delayed using tokens to distribute control of your project and build community due to fears of regulatory overreach, you should now have greater confidence in your project’s use of tokens as a legitimate and lawful tool. We’ll also soon release new guidance on the use of the\nDecentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA)\nfor projects looking to make the U.S. home, insulate tokenholders from liability, manage tax and compliance needs, and enable\ngreater economic activity\n. ​\nThe future of crypto in the U.S. is bright – it’s the perfect time to build here, and we’re excited about the possibility for regulatory clarity to finally come.\n***\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Gerry Tsoukalas (Boston University) examines their pricing structures, highlighting that while most use simple commission contracts to generate revenue, control over pricing varies: it may be centralized with the platform or decentralized, left to individual agents. We show these choices critically affect market outcomes (supply, adoption, welfare, etc.). Centralization enhances coordination but increases information asymmetry between the platform and its agents, whereas decentralization reverses this tradeoff. Neither approach is universally optimal. Using mechanism design, we propose a structural tweak to commission contracts, termed “affine pricing,” that can enable optimal market outcomes under either form of pricing control.

Human producers create content that is both sold directly to consumers and used as training data for AI. The AI generates a substitute good for human-generated content at zero marginal cost; the more training data the AI has access to, the higher quality the AI-generated content. The higher the quality of AI-generated content, the more consumers substitute away from human generated content, the lower the market price of human-generated content, the less human-generated content is produced, and the lower the profits to the human producers.\nEthan shows that, despite the fact that AI crowds out human production, because of price adjustments, exogenous improvements in the ability of AI to translate data into high-quality content, can benefit consumers. He also explores the effects of improvements in AI on innovation by human producers. He captures this by allowing for the possibility that human producers can pay a fixed cost to create a new product for which there is not any pre-existing training data, showing that exogenous improvements in AI can have non-monotone effects on the amount of innovation.\nAbout the presenter\nEthan is the Dean and Sydney Stein Professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.

        "title": "Seven things U.S. government agencies can do to help seize the web3 opportunity",
        "url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/seven-things-help-seize-web3-opportunity/",
        "content": "Crafting effective policy for emerging tech can be challenging, especially when that technology doesn’t fit into legacy regulatory frameworks. This is certainly the case in web3, where decentralized systems cannot — by their very nature — comply with traditional legal requirements. For example, current rules assume the existence of some kind of centralized intermediary, which is often not the case in web3. And those same rules seek to reduce the risks, like conflicts of interest and information asymmetries, that arise from the presence of trusted intermediaries, like a management team. Yet applying rules like this to decentralized systems risks forcing re-centralization, stymieing innovation, undermining the transformative potential of web3, and harming users.\nDecentralization is already reshaping areas like social media, identity management, creative industries, and certainly finance. But even though the U.S. is the developed nation with the\nhighest rate\nof crypto adoption, it does not have a functioning regulatory regime for decentralized crypto assets.\nWhile the U.S. has already made some progress (like\nFIT21\nand Wyoming’s\nDUNA\n), we still need significant legislative progress to provide regulatory clarity, properly encourage decentralization, and protect consumers.\nRegardless of who wins the U.S. election, there are simple steps that U.S. government departments and agencies could take today — absent legislation — to help the U.S. seize the web3 opportunity.\nHere are seven of the most important ones. While this list is incomplete, it should help the U.S. government and other stakeholders understand how they can move in the right direction.\n1. All relevant agencies should incorporate increasing competition and promoting innovation into their mandate\nAs Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz have\nwritten\n, the key to American technology supremacy has always been the startup. “A startup,” they observe, “is what happens when a plucky group of outcasts and misfits comes together with a dream, ambition, courage, and a particular set of skills — to build something new in the world, to build a product that will improve peoples’ lives, and to build a company that may go on to create many more new things in the future.” Edison, Jobs, and Musk are just a few of America’s startup champions. The U.S. has led in startups largely as the result of competitive innovation borne of our pioneering spirit, work ethic, rule of law, robust capital markets, education system, and public sector investment in research and development.\nThough startups can redefine — and in some cases even invent — entire industries, they begin with every possible disadvantage. Pitted against huge corporations with considerable user bases and financial resources, startups often struggle to get off the ground. Some incumbents may also have another advantage: the ability to position the government against startup competitors or promote costly rules which create a “regulatory barrier to entry.”\nIf startups are the lifeblood of American innovation then all agencies should incorporate increasing competition and promoting innovation into their mandate to ensure that these goals remain among their North Stars.\n2. The SEC should engage in formal rulemaking and provide clear guidance on the classification of digital asset transactions\nAs Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staffers struggle to define which crypto asset transactions are securities, imagine how hard it is for a normal user. As a consequence of this lack of clarity, the U.S. doesn’t have a functioning market in digital assets. To help fix this, the SEC should engage in rulemaking to provide clear instructions for market participants to understand whether transactions in a specific digital asset involve the sale of a security —  taking this action would have numerous implications. But since\n2019\n, the SEC has resisted calls to issue guidance to the public, choosing instead to engage in counterproductive\nregulation by enforcement\n, potentially harming businesses, confusing investors, and disrupting everyday users.\n3. Remove intermediary requirements where blockchains eliminate the need for third parties.\nA key innovation of blockchains is their capacity to facilitate transactions without the need for third-party, centralized intermediaries. Yet current rules designed for traditional markets presuppose the existence of centralized intermediaries like brokers, clearing agencies, custodians, and market makers. Where centralized businesses are involved in those functions, regulation is appropriate.\nBut treating decentralized systems in the same way prevents them from playing similar roles and precludes the benefits those systems provide. This amounts to a “\ntechnology-discriminating\n” approach. Disintermediating services reduces risks (like counterparty risk) and costs (like transaction fees) even as it increases efficiency and promotes competition. Where relevant, agencies should remove intermediary requirements if blockchain technology eliminates the need for intermediaries. For example, securities laws should not require intermediation when blockchain technology can achieve the same regulatory objectives.\nLikewise, by modernizing existing rules, agencies can help enable blockchains to revolutionize our financial system. Cross border payments, settlement of digital security and commodity transactions, and derivative markets could all be made much more efficient if existing rules are adapted to facilitate transactions taking place on blockchains.\n4. Promote transparency in agency decision making processes and increase engagement with private sector stakeholders, civil society organizations, academia, and the public\nPromoting transparency in agency decision-making processes is vital for creating sensible crypto policy. It builds trust, ensures accountability, and allows for public input. Open dialogue with stakeholders ultimately leads to more effective regulatory solutions — solutions that firms explore in partnership with regulators to ensure the agency’s full understanding of a dynamic market structure and a business’ aims, operations, and risk. When agencies openly share how decisions are made, it also prevents undue influence from special interests and helps ensure policies are balanced and fair.\nCritically, agencies should encourage — or at minimum permit — businesses to have educational meetings with regulators without fear of reprisals in the form of enforcement actions. This would help bring about what I’ve described as “\nregulation by conversation\n,” as opposed to regulation by enforcement.\nTransparency enables stakeholders, including innovators and the public, to provide feedback, fostering a more informed and inclusive approach to crypto regulation that reflects diverse perspectives and promotes long-term growth.\n5. Permit White House staff and federal agency employees to use crypto\nA 2022\nlegal advisory notice\nfrom the U.S. Office of Government Ethics prevents “employee[s] who [hold] any amount of a cryptocurrency or stablecoin” from working on crypto-related policy and regulation that could have an effect on the value of their assets. The notice applies to all White House staff and employees of federal agencies, and specifies that the\nde minimis\nthreshold available for securities is not applicable in the case of cryptocurrencies.\nMaintaining ethical standards around conflicts of interest is of course critical for establishing trust in governmental actions. But preventing government employees tasked with creating rules of the road for crypto from, well, using any amount of crypto is akin to prohibiting Department of Transportation officials from ever getting into a car or riding an airplane. Sensible policy comes from engagement and the knowledge it provides. Government employees charged with regulating crypto should be allowed to use it.\n6. Provide specialized training for government employees\nIn addition to benefiting from interacting with crypto, government employees would also benefit from specialized blockchain training — crucial for understanding decentralized innovation, informed policy decision-making, and effective use of enforcement resources. As decentralized systems reshape sectors like finance and cybersecurity, officials need to understand key concepts like blockchain analysis, smart contract design, and decentralized governance. This training can help officials understand how to leverage the transparent nature of blockchain to better achieve regulatory outcomes. It would also help governments to craft balanced regulations, support blockchain-driven innovation, and ensure that public sector initiatives align with the principles of decentralization and the public interest.\nPartnerships can turbocharge this training: By collaborating with industry, research organizations, and universities, governments can provide employees with access to cutting-edge research and expertise in blockchain technology. Where such initiatives (like the SEC’s\nStrategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology\n) already exist, agencies should take advantage of engagement with innovators, developers, and builders of new technologies.\n7. Support private-sector blockchain research and use zero knowledge proofs to better secure sensitive and proprietary information\nU.S. government agencies should also facilitate research into open source, permissionless blockchain systems to promote national security. Many of our adversaries, including Russia and China, are developing government-backed blockchain protocols that, if adopted globally, could provide adversarial governments with access to personally identifiable information and sensitive financial and operational data. U.S. agencies should support blockchain research to aid the development of private-sector solutions that can help combat the risk of the U.S. losing ground in the crypto space to other countries who do not share Western values.\nOne area in which government R&D can be of benefit is in the development of privacy-preserving technologies such as\nzero-knowledge proofs\n(ZKPs). ZKPs represent a step function improvement over other privacy-enhancing technologies, ensuring maximum privacy and control for users.\nZKPs can directly benefit U.S. government agencies, helping them enhance the security and privacy of information. Blockchains provide a decentralized, secure ledger that ensures that data is protected across multiple nodes. Encrypting and decentralizing information reduces the risk of hacks and service interruptions. ZKPs allow parties to verify the authenticity of information without revealing the actual data, making it possible to share only the necessary proof of identity or authorization without exposing sensitive details — for example, proving someone is above an age threshold without revealing their birthdate.\nTogether, blockchains and ZKPs can strengthen data integrity, improve trust in digital systems, and protect confidential information in various government operations. Agencies can also use decentralized systems to improve data transfer, communications, and more. Agencies should therefore consider using blockchain and ZKPs to preserve sensitive information such as private sector financial data and enhance efficiency.\n***\nThe U.S. needs to do more work to create a functioning crypto regulatory regime — one that incentivizes decentralization while protecting consumers. In the meantime, our hope is that this list of possible agency actions, albeit incomplete, will help U.S. agencies and other stakeholders understand how they can take steps in the right direction\nwithout\nwaiting for new legislation.\nAnd maybe, as we wait for legislation, staffers could be permitted to actually use some crypto.\n***\nBrian Quintenz\nis the Global Head of Policy for a16z crypto, and a former commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
