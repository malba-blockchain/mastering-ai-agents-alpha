To modify the agent instructions to ensure that when a user provides a Name as input, the agent can correctly find and fill the "ID Number" field, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the agent configuration page.

2. Select the Details in the navigation bar at the top of the authoring canvas or from the context menu for a topic on the Topics list page.

3. In the Details pane, navigate to the Inputs tab.

4. Create a new input variable by selecting "Create a new variable."

5. Enter a name for the input variable, select the data type, and provide a description.

6. Set the input variable to be dynamically filled with the best option by default. This allows the agent to populate the value from available context, such as extracting a value from the user‚Äôs message or previous conversation.

7. If necessary, override the input with a specific value by selecting "Set as a value" and entering the desired value.

8. Specify an entity type under "Identify as" to ensure the agent captures the correct type of value for the input.

9. Configure additional settings for the input to control the agent‚Äôs behavior when asking for a value or validating an answer from the user. 
Enable the "Should prompt user" property to ensure the agent tries to fill the variable with a value before executing the topic.

10. To customize the question the agent asks when it needs to prompt the user for input, select "Customize" under Prompt and enter your question, including references to variables or Power Fx formulas if needed.

11. Set the reprompt behavior by configuring the properties under "No valid entity found," such as the number of times the agent should try to get a valid answer and the retry prompt question.

These steps will help ensure that the agent can correctly find and fill the "ID Number" field when a user provides a Name as input.
