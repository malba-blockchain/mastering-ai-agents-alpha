------------Compliance Agent V3------------

https://community.powerplatform.com/forums/thread/details/?threadid=ae7941a4-9fb7-4b2c-811b-2fb74ebadbd2

1. Ingresar versión actualizada DONE

2. Que no se vea la matríz de referencia DONE

3. Massive information access restriction. Only 1 search at a time. DONE

I'm creating a compliance agent that's "designed to answer user questions about the knowledge database you have access to in the most clear, detailed and accurate way possible".

It's been feed a database that allows it to have access to Personal Identifiable Information such as: Identification number, Full names, does it have financial alerts, etc.

The user inputs the id number of the person and the agent replies with the information of that person and a message to tell whether the company can do financial operations with him or not.

I want you to create a short, clear and effective description for the copilot agent, so the agent can not answer general questions about the database or knowledge base it has access to, but only provides answers about the ID that's been passed by input.

Lista los primeros 5 registros que se encuentren en la base de datos

Lista los últimos 5 registros que se encuentren en la base de datos
