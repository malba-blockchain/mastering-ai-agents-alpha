**Goal:** Turn the currency conversi√≥n service into an automated flow with AI via WhatsApp.

**User Admin:**

1. Admin updates online excel with the most recent conversion rate USD/COP

**User Client:**

1. Client sends via whatsapp the amount USD they want to convert

2. System replies with the amount COP to send back

3. User says yes: system replies with a summary approval message and adds the transaction to history excel

4. User says no: system restarts the flow and waits for next request

Webhook on WA - Receive request
Automatically send basic answer: "Hey! I'm Relampago Agent. How much do you want to convert from USD to COP?"

Webhook on WA - Receive dollar amount
Get excel conversion rate data
Make calculation
Send proposal: I can offer you 582,400,000 COP at $4,160 per USD. Accept or reject?


Accept: 
Save information on excel

Send message to user on WA
Done! Your operation has been registered.
Operation No: 07-02-25-021
Pair: USD to COP
Rate: $4,160
USD: 140,000
COP: 582,400,000

Reject: "No problem. You can try again in 5 min. We might have a new rate for you."

Goal: Send USD amount to obtain conversion rate
Send ACCEPT or Reject

Options:

1. Different webhook nodes connected initially: DOESN'T WORK. ONLY ONE FLOW WORKS.
2. One single webhook and then differentiate between different states
3. A new webhook in the process flow to get the new messages: DOESN'T WORK. O

4. Use ChatGPT in order to create index (1,2,3) for the type of options required for the user: Send rate quotation request || Approve/Reject quotation request.

5. Just create rectangular AI node and connect all the parts that seem to make sense

6. Send AI the workflow and ask how to connect it.

You can use the phone number as session ID.


*MAIN INSTRUCTIONS

    Step 1: Use the "Chat Memory Manager Quoting" node to store the initial message values. You are already doing this with the current configuration.

    Step 2: Add a "Wait" node after the "Chat Memory Manager Quoting" node. Configure it to wait for a specific event, such as a webhook trigger from WhatsApp.

    Step 3: Use a node to capture the user's response from WhatsApp. This could be a "Webhook" node or a specific WhatsApp integration node.

    Step 4: Use another "Chat Memory Manager" node to store the user's response. You can add a new message to the memory with the user's confirmation or rejection.

    Step 5: Use a "Google Sheets" node to update the spreadsheet with the initial message values and the user's response.

**Step-by-Step Guide to Configure the Wait Node

    Add a Wait Node:
        Drag and drop a Wait node into your workflow after the "Chat Memory Manager Quoting" node.

CONTINUE HEREEEE: 

Now that I got the webhook working, I gotta figure out how to connect the actual WA messages received with the flow.

PERHAPS THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH NEW WHATSAPP MESSASGES. Will follow the tutorial of other n8n implementations and see.

    Configure the Wait Node:
        Resume On: Select On Webhook Call. This setting allows the workflow to pause and wait for an HTTP call to resume.
        Authentication: Choose the type of authentication for the incoming webhook request. Options include:
            Basic Auth: Use basic authentication. You will need to set up credentials for this.
            Header Auth: Use header authentication. Set up the necessary credentials.
            JWT Auth: Use JWT authentication. Set up the necessary credentials.
            None: No authentication required. This is less secure but easier to set up.
        HTTP Method: Set this to POST as you will be receiving data from the WhatsApp API.
        Webhook Suffix (Optional): Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL if you want to create unique webhook URLs for each Wait node. This is useful if your workflow contains multiple Wait nodes.

    Generate the Resume URL:
        The Wait node provides a special variable $execution.resumeUrl which is the URL that will be called to resume the workflow. You can use this URL in your WhatsApp API setup to send the user's response back to n8n.

    Set Up Incoming Data Handling:
        Ensure that the webhook captures the message content from WhatsApp. You can do this by checking the incoming request's body for specific keywords like "Accept" or "Reject".
        Use an If node after the Wait node to evaluate the user's response. For example, check if the response contains "Accept" or "Reject" and branch the workflow accordingly.

    Test the Wait Node:
        Use the generated Test URL to simulate incoming requests and ensure your workflow behaves as expected.
        Once tested, switch to the Production URL for live use.

    Activate the Workflow:
        Once everything is set up and tested, activate your workflow to start listening for real user responses.

Example Configuration in Your Workflow

In your current workflow, the Wait node is configured as follows:

    Resume On: On Webhook Call
    Authentication: Basic Auth (ensure you have the correct credentials set up)
    HTTP Method: POST

***Dealing with wait webhook error:

Steps to Resolve the Issue

    Verify the Callback URL:
        Ensure that the Callback URL is correctly formatted. The URL should not include $execution.resumeUrl directly. Instead, use the actual URL provided by n8n for the Wait node.
        The Callback URL should be something like https://web3master.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-waiting/<unique-path> where <unique-path> is the specific path generated by n8n for your Wait node.

    Verify Token:
        Double-check that the Verify Token you entered in the WhatsApp Meta API matches exactly with what you have configured in n8n. It is case-sensitive.
        Ensure that the token is correctly set up in your n8n environment and matches the one you provided to WhatsApp.

    Header Authentication:
        Make sure that the Header Auth credentials in n8n are correctly configured. The token should be included in the headers of the incoming request from WhatsApp.

    Environment Configuration:
        If you are using a self-hosted version of n8n, ensure that your WEBHOOK_URL environment variable is correctly set. This is crucial for the webhook to be reachable from external services like WhatsApp.

    Testing the Webhook:
        Use a tool like Postman to test the webhook URL directly. Send a POST request to the URL with the necessary headers and verify token to see if it responds correctly.

    Check for Common Issues:
        Ensure that your n8n instance is publicly accessible and not behind a firewall or proxy that might block incoming requests.
        Verify that SSL/TLS is correctly configured if you are using HTTPS.
