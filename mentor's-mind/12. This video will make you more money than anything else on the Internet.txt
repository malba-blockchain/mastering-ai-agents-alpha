00:00:00	how to sell the same thing for more money by making offers so good people feel stupid saying no the agenda number one why nailing your offer will make you more money than anything else number two why selling to the right people makes you more money more than almost anything else too number three why you should charge lots of money for the stuff you sell number four how to reverse engineer value and number five I have a pretty sweet demonstration I'll do for you guys how to use scarcity urges and guarantees

00:00:31	to make people want it even more and charge more more and more double more more money good all right so let's start here by nailing your offer we'll make you more money than anything else so this is my uh this is my big aha moment so this is me when I was 23. uh just signed my lease super excited arms look better there than they do now but it's all good uh and uh had no idea what I was doing I'd never sold anything I'd never marketed never gotten leads I had no no clue what I was doing and so I spent

00:01:03	three thousand dollars of money that I didn't have only at ten thousand dollars at the time so I spent a third of my net worth on a workshop that's supposed to be a two-day workshop that was going to teach me how to get leads and it was this brand new thing that was on the internet it was called Facebook ads it's 2013. I was super early this is where luck plays plays a role so into this workshop and I was there I didn't have a real business yet because I wasn't open and the guy pulls me aside and he could

00:01:29	see that I had no clue what I was doing I was like trying to take notes but didn't even have context to take notes with and uh he's like hey you wanna know the secret to sales that's my faint Australian accent um he said uh he said make people an offer so good they feel stupid saying no and that was actually the first thing that anyone ever told me about selling and so it changed my life and so I tried to tell as many people as I can because if you get that part right everything else is easy and I was very fortunate in that I had

00:02:05	somebody very early on who told me that and so I tried to tell to as many people as I can as loud as I can it don't book about it and so I realized in that moment that I didn't be good at sales good at marketing I'm really good at anything because I wasn't at the time I just had to make my offer good enough and that was when the greatest game of my life began and so for those who don't know it offers what you literally give someone in exchange for money all right there's the product that's the stuff

00:02:30	the market is the peoples and the offers the thing that Bridges those two all right and so it packages and communicates what you do in exchange for the dollars a shitty offer weekly connects to the market very little flow very shitty or for some of you if you haven't made sales yet that might be your problem as well so here's how you know if you have a shitty offer number one it's hard to get leads number two most people don't want to buy number three if they do want to buy they compare your prices to someone

00:02:57	else no bueno and here's why what many people do is they try and just well many people do is they try and create another and also ran right and what ends up happening is that the prospect makes a price driven decision rather than a value driven decision and so they think to themselves these two things are the same I will therefore take the lower price right and so we have to fight very hard or very intelligently on how to break that that cycle all right and so this is what it looks like when it's

00:03:30	wrong these two are close enough I think I'll get the cheaper one very sad for all of us a strong offer connects to the big part of the market so that you make more Monies so here if you make and I'm going to show you cool demonstration at the end of this but if you can make an offer the entire Niche that you're going after it's like I need this then you're gonna have a lot easier time getting leads a lot easier time selling and a lot of times it's doing more work than your competitors are willing to do

00:04:01	and that is what's going to shift people to a value-driven decision which is I really want this thing gosh it's expensive but I don't think anyone else could do it that's where you want to be because then you can make up your prices great place to be in and the reason it's so important for making money is that when you get this right number one you increase response rates on all of your advertisements in whatever way you advertise when I say advertise I mean to make things known number two increase conversion so think sales so

00:04:29	more people that you talk to will say yes to you if the offer is right number three premium pricing which means not only will you have more people respond to your ads and more people say yes but they'll say yes at higher prices and when you have more and more more you make more and more and more money so right now my current return on Advertising my career is 36 to 1. that's not a typo our portfolio is a whole generates over 200 million dollars a year and a big part of that is nailing the offer

00:04:56	and so nailing the offer is the single strongest lever on your business success so let me just show you how much so this was a traditional agency offer that we worked on ages ago but we just changed one thing about the business model just the offer we didn't change any of the mechanics in the business what they actually did nothing we just changed the offer so what they used to do is they were generic Facebook ads agency who here knows what I'm talking about with that anybody yes okay you know these

00:05:25	ones everybody has one your mom has one your mom's basement has a kid in it who also does it too right thousand down thousand a month I'll run your ads for you right there you go we were doing Facebook ads you get leads maybe maybe you don't you pay us just the same pretty generic pretty shitty offer and so this is what their actual return on Advertising was for their advertising expense so they're spending ten thousand dollars a month they reach 300 000 people the response rate between Impressions to people who click

00:05:56	um they got 40 book calls from that shortly 75 appointments who showed was 30 closing was 16 close five price points a thousand so they spent ten they made five so they're making point five to one kind of shitty but 30 days later they're at one to one and then so forth right it's pretty normal and this is actually pretty common in a lot of businesses some of you guys may have numbers like this right now so let me show you a new way so this is the offer that we changed it to so rather than a thousand down a

00:06:25	thousand a month we said it's 4K down one time setup no monthly fee and only pay me when people show up we'll run the ads for you and we had an implied guarantee because if no one showed up you wouldn't have to pay us ever again obviously we're invested in getting paid again we prefer to get paid and so we will try and get as many people to show up as humanly possible cool simple so same initial stuff spend ten thousand dollars same number of Impressions three hundred thousand but two and a half times the response rate

00:06:56	that's more number one say now because of that response rate the actual percentage stay the same now we got 100 though of points about rather than 40. and our sure remain the same so now we have 75 appointments versus 30. we would already call this a win would you not this would be a win in your business two and a half X cool but then we got more and more because we closed 2.3 times more people who got on the phone than we were before but we already had two and a half times more people ah more more second more

00:07:27	so we went from five sales for ten thousand dollars 228 sales for ten thousand dollars more money good and the price point up front went from one thousand dollars to four thousand dollars so we have two and a half times the response rate 2.3 x the close rate at four times the price which resulted in a hundred and twelve thousand dollars in cash collected up front from that ten thousand dollars which is 11.2 to 1 which from a comparison standpoint was 22 times as effective just the offer didn't change anything

00:08:03	else and so I say this to demonstrate one thing which is that right now most of you could dramatically improve your offer and make a load more money cool fantastic so if you went from whatever you convinced yourself you're okay with to ten times better row as would that be interesting to you fantastic all right so this is what you will get from this presentation this is the stuff you will learn if you actually do something as a result number one more leads for the same price two more sales for the same call volume three more

00:08:31	money for the same stuff so natural question is how so I'll spend the rest of this President doing my best damnedest to explain it all right so nil number one number two why selling to the right people makes you more money so you want to see you want to sell to people who are valuable because of who they are rather than who you are all right so I'll leave you a little example so who you're familiar with conversion rate optimization cro anyone heard that term it's basically people who look at your

00:08:58	website and say We'll change a bunch of doodads and more people are going to collect more people in opt-in okay very simple in the Ecom world it's more common than in the coaching world no idea why when I say coaching I mean Services Etc um no idea why it is that way but it is all right now so let's say you own that and you work on an e-commerce business is doing a million dollars a year and you have a 10 increase in throughput which is very common it's actually on the low end for most cro agencies so you increase that

00:09:26	business by a hundred thousand dollars a year that's value right and you charge thirty six thousand dollars a year to do that all right cool we got a 36 of the value that you added neat now let's say that you did the same exact work on a business that's doing a hundred million dollars a year in e-commerce get the same 10 increase you make them 10 million dollars more now you can charge the same percentage of the increase and you make 30 3.6 million dollars for that one job same work 100 times the pay

00:09:59	who would like it 100 times pay increase yes me too I'm with you all right and so the big Point here is that a lot of people think even the offer itself has to be amazing which it does but the next piece of this is to make sure that we're presenting to the right people so the same work occurred in both of those scenarios but because this person inherently was more valuable we get paid more because we created more value for them for the same work that is leverage by the way the definition of leverages you get more for

00:10:33	what you put in high leverage put a little in get a lot out low leverage but a lot and get a little out this is a higher leverage play having a better offer is higher leverage you do the same work you get more responses you get more sales higher prices is this making sense cool so this is a story that I like a lot to drive this point on so Dad buys this kid a car it's a clunker looks like this you can imagine it right and the kid's like I don't know if I want the car he's like well you can scrap it take the cash and you can put

00:11:01	it towards whatever car you want he says okay he's like well where should I go he's like well why don't you go to the uh go to the dealership see what they'll give you it goes the dealership says hey you know we'll give you we'll give you five grand for the car he's like okay so he goes back to his dad he's like hey they said they'll give me five grand he's like okay why don't you go to the uh the pawn shop down the street the scrap yard see what they'll give you maybe the medal is worth more this goes the scrap yard has same

00:11:25	conversation when I saw the car they said we'll give you 500 bucks he was like oh 500 bucks goes back to his dad sulks and he's like they're only going to be 500 for the car he's like okay he's like why don't you go to that uh that collector thing down the street you already know where this is going go to the collector's thing down the street he's like hey I'm thinking about selling my car and they're like dude you have a historic blah blah blah that's a hundred thousand dollar there's only 20 of these left

00:11:53	comes back to his dad his dad's smiling because he knows what happened and the lesson he wanted to teach his son is if you're not being hello it sounded more dramatic that way if you're not being valued it's because of the people that are placing the value on you and so a lot of times I feel like we deal with this with a lot of like again a customer segmentation that's beyond the scope of this this presentation but if you look at all the customers you have there are customers that pay you five ten times more than

00:12:25	your other customers right but if you just had those right it's a lot easier to make that person more value because of who they are not even because of who you are right and so the person on the other side of the table matters just as much as this thing you're telling them sometimes more there you go the value derive is often about who you find not necessarily what you provide and so this is a final little one I'll drive this home with so there was a guy who's broke down on the side of the street

00:12:52	he was super upset big red car there lots of fumes I don't know I have two car examples but go with it and and uh guys driving by stops on the side of the road and starts pushing has anyone seen this before in their lives okay what's interesting is that this guy who decided to be the Good Samaritan for the day helped the other guy out nothing crazy normal thing when he got back home he found out that the man on the side of the road was a billionaire and he had paid off his mortgage which I think is really cool it's a real story

00:13:23	and so it wasn't a function of what he did it was a function of who he helped so most people could push a car and probably not get anything besides a thank you which is fine and that's cool because they didn't do it for that but in this particular instance he got his entire house paid off because of who he chose to serve and so right now you probably have pain in the ass clients who suck and you got a couple of them are pretty cool get more of them and one of the hardest things in business is being able to say no but I

00:13:51	promise you that if you're able to say no to people who suck you'll make room for people who don't suck and those people will pay you a lot more money thank you facts so who do I decide to go after if this is what I'm going to decide to do awesome I'll give you a little framework for this so when we look at markets that we want to go after and this is at a market level you can actually drill close to this in terms of customer segmentation there's four characteristics we look for number one is pain number two is

00:14:21	purchasing power so do they have the problem to solve do they got the money to spend can we find them easily and are they going to be bigger tomorrow than they are today right because you could reverse this and say how do I find somebody who doesn't give a can't afford the thing I can't find them it's actually shrinking right so let's not do that let's do the opposite of that all right so anyone heard this uh you might have heard this example so if you have a hot dog stand right and you're trying to

00:14:48	sell the most hot dogs so this is going to be we're gonna do this live today if you can just shout them out as loud as you can because you have no mic and I do if you wanted to sell the most hot dogs and we're in a contest and I said I'll give a 100 Grand of the person who sells the most hot dogs what would be the one advantage that you would want read my book so normally I would go through this they'd be like the best hot dogs the best packaging the best whatever right the best marketing the answer is you want to be right

00:15:20	outside the stadium when the drunk crowd gets out you want to starve and crowd you can sell inside of a bun as long as it even resembles a hot dog and you will sell out and so the idea here is that we want to find the starving crowd and the thing is is that within markets there are sub segments that are starving and they're wildly underserved and they have lots of money and just no one has done a good job by presenting the right offer to them number two purchasing power so a friend of mine actually read this

00:15:49	book um and like was going through this process and he was like I think I've got my perfect audience it's unemployed people I help them with their resumes they get jobs this is a huge Marketplace it's growing right um he gets on the phone with me after like a month of this like crazy great idea he's like you wouldn't believe it and I was like tell me it's like they can't afford a 300 consultation it's like I I can believe it and I was like what's the main reason they're giving you you say they're

00:16:21	saying they don't have any income right now it's like wild thought and so when you're selling something you want to make sure that the person you have is purchasing power I will tell you something that I've anecdotally found is that the more I re I reveal about how expensive something is earlier on the process the more money out something they make a lot of people like to hide that and they try to like you know obfuscate you know trying to like hold it back and not tell people I don't want to scare people off

00:16:47	people usually have an idea of a range of what something is and if someone is like so shock value that they won't get on the phone they're probably not going to close so I have been I've made more money it has cost me more money per call but I've made higher return on my advertising by having that stuff but most people are afraid of that because they only look at the front end metrics rather than the back end metrics so number three is we want to find find people are easy right and so if they're not aggregated somewhere it

00:17:14	becomes very difficult to advertise to them right we can't make our ship known to them if we can't find them right if you're trying to reach Rich doctors it's much easier to do that than I don't know something that some of you guys are going after like you got to be able to find this this is really tactical but like this is why I love niches when you have like associations and Facebook groups and Professional Services around this particular audience it becomes very easy to Target them and not only that it becomes easy to Target

00:17:40	them across all platforms and it becomes easy to do outbound to them because you can find those lists like there's so many different ways to advertise to them they get easy rather than thinking creative innovative ways to do it again there are other ways but why not make it easier like if we're going to do it might as well just pick the the the deck steps in our favor right and so the last one is one that I learned from Uncle Warren right which is he tells a story that that has always stuck with me

00:18:09	I said when I was at Columbia business school he and it he had his closest friend of Colombia and they were kind of equivalent in every way super smart really hard working Etc and when they graduated they went their separate ways he went to get into you know private equity and investing Etc and his friend went into the steel business and worked really hard et cetera et cetera fast forward 30 years his friend did decently well he you know rose up in the company steals a hard business they can't pay as well et

00:18:38	cetera this was an American Steel was kind of in turmoil Etc and um two guys same IQ ish same same work ethic Warren becomes an ultra billionaire the other guy he's just a normal dude and he said that's when I learned how important it was that it wasn't about how hard you row but the boat you're in and so a lot of us are are rowing in the wrong boat and we're wrong as hard as we can but we're actually in the wrong vehicle and so when we're when we're trying to pick the market that we're going after you don't want to pick Steel

00:19:13	in the U.S when he was graduating from college a good friend of mine had a newspaper business he was a SAS dude from YC slick back hair the whole thing looked fancy and he was like dude we're not growing anymore he's like I've changed the the offer I've got you know I've got my sales team he's doing all this stuff I was like bro do you want me to say it he was like what do you mean it's like newspapers shrinking 25 a year compounded against you not even like neutral like negative compounding people

00:19:45	like 25 a year returns like do that for 10 years the other way very bad and so he's like even though we're gaining market share I was like yeah but the Market's this big right and so the thing is there's an old VC saying ventric Apple saying he said when a great manager meets a bad Market the market wins right and so a lot of us are trying we're rolling in the wrong boat you're pursuing people who suck if you go to places or you go to markets that are growing you grow by default there are some people this is the nice thing that we

00:20:15	have is that we all just went through covet whatever time ago it was who here saw a big increase in their business who here saw a big decrease in their business well good for you guys for everybody else um the point is is that you actually got to see in real time the difference between markets like the market was actually behind you and it got so much easier and so if we have the ability to decide what we're going to sell and to whom we might as well stack the deck right so number one why nailing your offer is the most

00:20:47	important thing that you can do to make more money number two why selling the right people makes more money did I make that point cool all right number three here's why you should charge a lot of money for it aka the right price one of my favorite quotes from Dan Kennedy charge as much as you can without cracking a smile and so there's three little Frameworks I'm going to give you as quickly as I can because I want to get to some of the cool other stuff um there's price to Value discrepancy so price is what you pay value is what you

00:21:13	get this is also a Warren Buffett quote you can imagine the top line is the value the middle line is the price and when your value declines the point where the price sorry the value Dives below the price is where people cancel if you have a recurring Revenue business or people don't buy right and so every single person wants a bargain this is an important point you could sell something for a hundred million dollars and it could be a bargain so price has nothing to do with the discrepancy between price and value

00:21:42	there's both variables right and the problem is most business owners focus on the wrong side and so there's two ways you can increase that discrepancy number one the hard way is that you can lower your prices right if you lower your prices you increase the discrepancy makes sense right it also sucks because it's a great way to compete on prices commodity remember the apples and oranges we're doing the Apples to Apples shitty life right and what happens is you end up losing most of your money I have this nice visual didn't come up

00:22:12	okay it's all good the other way to do this is the easy way right is that you can compute on value and create a value driven decision rather than a price driven decision and so this is where we start stacking as many things as we can on this rubber band of value to keep driving it as high as we can imagine so that the price just follows as a result and so we want to charge 10 times more than we are now for something a hundred times as valuable I showed you an example of how we could do 100 times more value just by serving

00:22:42	a better customer but does that make sense this is how you make tons of money is by jacking the out of the value so much so that people are like this is not the same as everything else I have nothing to compare this to I have to take whatever number they give me is the only data point I have to compare to Dan Kennedy said you want to sell in a vacuum no one else is in the room you're like it's just you and me baby I'm all you got right and so that's what we want to do in our sales conversations where they

00:23:11	have no alternative there's nothing else that they can do or nowhere else to go or no one else who can solve this problem all right it's remember this is one that's always useful to remind people of you can only go down to zero like you can only go so low on the price but you can go infinitely high in the other direction on value so I would want to tie myself to the thing that I can infinitely go up on rather than the one that I can only compress to zero so the goal is that they buy a tremendous amount of value at a discount

00:23:40	we still want them to get a deal but we do it by pushing the other side the nice thing that happens when you do this and this is what most people do when they're picking their price so who here has picked a price for something they're selling recently can I get hand thank you by the way means the world to me that when you raise your hands when I do that because it gives me feedback Okay so this is what most people do they look at the marketplace they look what everyone else is doing number two they see what everyone else offers in

00:24:08	terms of what they're actually providing number three they take the average number four they go slightly below to remain competitive of course and then they provide with their competitor offers a little bit more for a little bit less right great value what's interesting about that is that they're looking competitors and the funny thing is everyone's broke you might not know this mushroom competitors broke I see a ton of penile statements every single day they come in for acquisition.com so many businesses

00:24:40	broke as don't look at that they don't know what they're doing why would you take the average of the mediocre right don't look at that they're poor forget about it right there we go that was that was the slot I wanted to show you what happens is when you have a commodity driven or a price driven Market we're offering you continue to compete on price and so what happens is everyone offers a little bit more for a little bit less and they keep going until basically everyone's a non-profit everyone keeps their head

00:25:11	barely above water one month's profitable one month's not one month profitable is this am I telling anybody their life story right now anyone okay and it's because you're playing the wrong game it's the wrong game you have to be in a place where it doesn't matter what anyone else is charging because why would you want to compete with them then you have to be compared ah sucks no fun right so we want to have a virtuous cycle of price rather than a vicious cycle or price because everyone's doing a little bit more for a little bit less

00:25:39	a little bit more for a little bit less then everyone can't do any more for any less which sucks so this is the better way call this The Virtuous cycle of price when you increase your price your prospects increase their emotional investment they increase their perceived value when you increase your price their results increase as a consequence of their emotional investment their demandingness goes down when you charge more anyone had the rich client who just says oh yeah I set the wire this morning and then somebody's

00:26:11	fighting you over fifty dollars anyone else yes of course I'm a great client I just send money am I just don't be an ass thank you right when you increase the price I can't even ruin what it says revenue for fulfillment per customer you make more money so you can actually do better for them so you're actually in a very real way get better and the more you do this the more your price goes up the more their emotional investment goes up the more they value it the better the results get the less demanding they are and the more money

00:26:41	you have left over to continue to reinvest in the value you can provide them becomes a virtuous cycle right and the flip side of that is that you decrease your price they decrease their emotional investment they decrease the perceived value because they see you as a cheap alternative they decrease the results because they don't give a about it they become more demanding because they're Cheapskates and then finally you have less money left over to provide value is this making sense okay and oh wait there's more your business

00:27:06	when you increase your price you make way more profit right you feel better because you're like I'm a good business person I make money I'm good at this game right so you increase your you you increase your profit you increase how much you feel about yourself your perception of impact because the results goes up because you're like I'm doing good in the world not only am I making more money am I good at business I'm actually helping people because I have profit left over to actually invest in the value right

00:27:30	now our service level increases because the people that I can attract as a result right because you can pay more people like from a playlist thing and we have sales team conviction and this is actually a really underrated one I've trained a lot of sales teams in my life the one thing that trumps all training is belief and if they believe the heart of the founder the heart of the CEO is to actually help the people that you are selling to they will sell with a completely different frame the best salesperson that we had in our

00:28:05	in our company at gym launcher we still have I have heard his calls the man is a Savage like board like psychopath love you I've heard him on calls after the third or fourth objection and he'll just take his dig his head off and he'll rub his eyes and he's like I'm not giving up on you Dad he's like I I know you need this I know you got a lot of stuff that's that's preventing he's like but I know that this is the thing that you need to get to where you want to go he's like so let's let's keep talking

00:28:40	through it let's figure this out man it's like there's only one way that your life's Gonna Change is through us like I know everyone else's stuff I know you got no other options like I'm your guy so let's make this work and like I have seen him do this again and again now how many people on your sales team after they get one objection they're like no no you should yeah think about it right because they don't believe because if they really believed this is a this is a really good example so let's say that you could go back in

00:29:10	time to yourself and give yourself one investing tip just one 10 years ago there's probably a stock or a thing or whatever that was really small then would be really big now probably change your life right think of that thing in your head now imagine you go now but you don't look like you but you're seeing your old self 10 years ago and you're like you have to do this thing and you can't say that it's you how convicted would you be to get them to do the thing they'd be like no I'm not really interested I don't really know any of

00:29:42	that stuff you're like you need to do this you're like come on man the thing is is that that frame is the frame of what good salesmen sell with because they genuinely want the person to do the thing to benefit if you are the cheapest price and that's not what you built your business strategy around so I want to be very clear there is a strategy for being the low-cost leader virtually every person who I've heard say that they're cutting their prices to get more customers that was not the strategy that started their

00:30:13	business with the only way you can start that is your strategy is that from day one you have a cost driven culture you build a Tech Tool that automates a ton of manual labor you take labor from overseas exclusively you have a culture of cost-cutting budgeting like Walmart that's their strategy for virtually everyone else there is no benefit to trying to keep cutting your prices but there's a very big one for being the most valuable you dig all right quick one so they did this science experiment

00:30:44	which I think is really cool and they presented three wines to blind taste testers and they said they didn't say this they're like there's a cheap wine there's a middle price wine an expensive one so those are the three wines they people try them right and then after they tried them they had them rate them so they said the the cheap one tasted like cheap wine the middle one tastes like medium wine and the expensive one tasted like great one right here's what's Wild they're the exact same wine there is a bi-directional relations

00:31:14	between price and value people if you want to in a very real way increase the value that people perceive about your product you can make it more expensive and they will value it more how nuts is that it also makes it more money right there's my head right blowing up which means price itself is a component of value so the goal is to be so much more expensive that a consumer must pause and think this can't be the same category of solution as everyone else it's so much more expensive this can't be the same thing right and then it

00:31:54	pulls you into another category so you make a decision or you force them to make a decision in a vacuum all right no if you have any kind of service this is more for services if you have a service where a client has to perform something in order to be successful then it would follow that the more invested they are the more invested they'll be which in turn creates better students and better outcomes so like if you want to help someone you have to charge them enough that it would hurt them so that they actually do

00:32:22	it the most the most successful weight loss offer I think of all time I am a little bit biased was the one that we ran for gym launch it's called the six-week challenge here's the stick people would come in we would say Hey you can lose 20 pounds in six weeks you put 500 down if you lose the weight you get the money back everyone had real skin in the game there's a number one offer for the entire industry for almost five years because it was so compelling compared to like a membership or whatever

00:32:54	thing that was out there and when we did that we had 78 of people succeed and hit the goal people were like oh is this shake that you like no one hit it I was like no people want to get their money back the stick was that most people need to lose more than 20 pounds right or when you lose 20 pounds you look yourself in me you're like I look pretty flat and you're like right you should tone up we should do the rest of this stuff right so that was the thing but they believed that we could help them because we did and we got them

00:33:21	invested more than a traditional gym membership was remember we're competing against 29 memberships so 500 is very very expensive does that make sense think about how you can apply this within your own business to separate and create another category right so when you charge more you also as a side note increase the quality of your prospects which increases the quality of your product like I said earlier with the cro example if you increase the prices it takes all the shitty people out and then by doing

00:33:50	that you only get people who are smarter more able et cetera and then all of a sudden your percentage results go up because you're dealing with the right people right don't have to sell to everybody so we actually did this with one this is a different weight loss brand one of our portfolio companies they were doing 450 000 a month five to one row as close rate was 30 percent profit was about 150 000 a month and so we made one change to the business I looked at everything I was like we're just going to raise your price by

00:34:18	50 and change nothing else it was like what about all the other like let's just do that it's like really like that's that's it that's what we're gonna do like of all the levers we have in percentage like I'd already done a bunch of research on other people that are competitors Etc I was like I think the price the market can stay sustain this here's what's crazy went to a million a month within eight weeks went to ten to one row as their close rate went up and their profit almost tripled in eight

00:34:55	weeks because people believe that the thing was going to be worth more and they got better results as a consequence and they got better people to buy there you go so 2.76 or six seven okay that's why you should charge a lot for it so making making offers or making more money than anything else number two while making while selling the right people will make you more money number three why you should charge a lot of money for it number four how to reverse engineer value I'm gonna do it on time okay so

00:35:27	I'm gonna go over is that cool is that all right okay so if you're gonna charge a lot of money for it you might as well make it remarkable so this was our gym Lords event there's 700 people in this room 42 000 here each wild right so my dad saw this picture on Facebook cost me out and he's like hey I saw that event I thought it was supposed to be like for your really expensive highest paying people I was like it was he's like no the one that was like 40 000 a year I was like yeah it was like do they know

00:36:10	that you're that you're charging them that money and I was like yeah they're aware I'm not magically siphoning money from their account they're aware but like blue is I couldn't couldn't fathom it right it's 28 million dollars right there and so it was like okay so I could this was like a teaching moment right so I was like all right well I'll bet you that you would pay me that amount of money too he's like what I was like okay so let's say that I could triple the profit of your business because he's a small

00:36:44	business owner he's like okay I was like and I would uh and I could do that he's like well what would I have to do it's like you'd have to show up 10 hours a week more than you currently do he's like okay I could do that it's like well had anyone like would anybody else have already done this thing too and I was like yeah 4 000 people would already have gone through the same process that's what I would be taking you through it's like how long would I have to wait it's like about a year for you to get I

00:37:17	was like it would be eight weeks for you to Roi and then 12 months yes okay well then you know what we're gonna do value equation is awesome rocks there's four variables you got to charge something that's uh have a dream outcome that's amazing you have to increase the perceived likelihood of achievement which is the questions my father was asking me you have to do it as fast as you can you have to make it as easy as possible if you think about those four things within the value that you're charging you will make something

00:37:42	more valuable so good fast cheap easy so how can you make it easier how can you deliver it faster how can you make sure it's something they actually want and how can you increase or decrease the risk that they associate with the purchase does that make sense okay so lots of variables lots of da very fun there's a whole process to this exciting cool everyone understand how to reverse engineer value fantastic so we got two left or this is the one left so here's my quick recap I haven't understand why making a better offer the

00:38:16	strongest level you have to grow your business yes number two and you can say yes back does everyone understand that a big component of values picking the right people say yes does everyone understand the direct link between price and value and that increasing of both increases the perceived value and your profits say yes number four does everyone understand that value isn't an amorphous word but a formula that can be repeated over and over again say yes all right last piece is a demonstration so I said
