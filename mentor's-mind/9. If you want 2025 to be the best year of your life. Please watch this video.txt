00:00:00	here's my advice to make 2025 the best year of your life there's four steps eliminate distractions get started get better never stop number one elimination of the things that are distracting you when I was young my father gave me this advice rich people buy time poor people buy stuff ambitious people buy skills lazy people by Distraction I can give you the first and easiest 2025 prediction look at what you spend money on look at your calendar and wherever you invest is what you will get more of

00:00:32	so many people are surprised when they look at their bank account next year and it's lower than they want it to be they look at their accomplishments from that year and it's not the things they set out to do but when you look at their calendar and their credit card expenses it's very obvious why those things didn't happen because we vote with our dollars about the things that we care about we vote about the type of person that we want to become and as the first thing that you can do today for next

00:00:55	year is actually comment below this video and I rarely ask for this the thing that you're actually going to do today not what you're going to begin doing next year or what your resolution is going to be but if it's important enough to do for future you it's certainly important enough to do for current you because current you by the way is the only you that's ever going to enjoy life I'll give you this story so I remember when I was a few years back I was walking with ilila and we went to Sephora which is like a makeup store so

00:01:21	we walked inside you know I'm sitting you know standing there awkwardly cuz I'm like I don't know what I'm supposed to do here there's this lady with the smok who like helps out and she had these two girls who were young they must have been Maybe well about this this old I'm guessing between 9 and 40 who knows she's leaning over and she has these two paintbrushes in her hands and she says okay girls now that you guys are women you need to start budgeting for this stuff because you're going to be

00:01:43	spending money on this every single month to do your makeup and so the girls grabbed them they were super excited and they went to go check out and I saw that exchange as actually a really beautiful lesson when it comes to Identity our priorities we dictate by what we spend not by what we say these girls because they wanted to step into this new identity had to match it with new priorities so they had money or they had saved up their shekels or whatever they do for chores or babysitting or whatever

00:02:09	by doing that they had to start prioritizing some of that money towards their new identity from girls to women but the thing is is that many people who want to start next year think okay well I'm just going to see if this happens but it doesn't work that way you have to basically make the decision that this is the type of person that I want to become and then these are the actions that that type of person would take and then we align our calendars and our budgets in accordance with that so that the

00:02:35	Investments we make yield the results that we want but the thing is is that people want to say hey wouldn't it be great if I owned Apple but they never buy the stock if you want to be that version of you you need to start buying stock in that today both by paying in time and paying in money to vote with your dollars about what you truly care about and the reason that I'm hitting this so hard is that it's never been easier than it is today to be successful it's also never been easier to be distracted Ed so along the theme of

00:03:02	investing in the things that matter most the first thing we do is we eliminate all the stuff that sucks I Define commitment is the elimination of Alternatives if you get married you eliminate all people of whatever sex you're married to that are not that person actually you eliminate everyone who's not that person independent of sex right that is a commitment right if you enter into a uh partnership and you say I'm not going to do any business besides this business as part of the terms then you've eliminated all Alternatives and

00:03:28	so if you want someone to commit ask them to elate everything else that's not the main thing these are all the things a laundry list of things that are probably not your main thing that very likely are getting in the way and these are the most common things that I see in my DMs that I see in my comments from people who are not getting where they want to go as fast as it'd like to get there first big category is bad friends so if you want better friends get used to seeing them less better friends are

00:03:54	busy friends so I remember when I started working more and some of the friends that I had were a little bit more ambitious I started realizing that the people that I liked the most I actually didn't spend as much time with and the people that were always available were the ones that I didn't want to become more like here's five questions you should consider when thinking about whether to keep a friend in your life or cut them question number one is if someone told you that you're a lot like your friend would you take that

00:04:22	as a compliment second are you truly fulfilled by the friendship or is it just someone to keep you from being lonely third are you able to be unapologetically yourself or do you feel the need to act differently to please that friend or to be around that friend fourth do you like who this friend is right now today or do you like the idea of the friend and who they could be someday and then finally five would you want your future or imagined child to be friends with someone like this person and I think it's a really wonderful

00:04:58	litmus test because it forces you to take a look outside of yourself in order to have perspective from a third-party angle on the true quality of that person but the reality is that rare people are by definition rare it's normal to have fewer of them and so if you only have a few friends or one good friend then that's normal if you want rare and exceptional friends if you have many friends it's far more likely that the bar for your friendship is too low and to give you a filter that I actually used for the most important friend in my

00:05:31	life Leila I like to think does this person have the same scale of goals that I have so does it mean that they have to have the same goals as you but it has to be the same level of goals as you because at least you're going in the same direction so that's number one number two is do they have the same level of dedication and commitment to those goals because I don't know about you but I had plenty of friends who were like I want to be an NFL player I want to be a a really rich Tech entrepreneur

00:05:57	I want to be a a touring musician right and they had these goals but I'm like dudee I see you just playing fortnite four hours a day and you you practice guitar once a week like what do you really want that or do you just like saying it because it makes you feel good and so I wanted people who walked the walk and I wanted people who would keep up with my pace and if you are someone who's ambitious and this is me just talking specifically to you because there's only a few people who are watching this who really are and you'll

00:06:22	know that if it's you you have to get used to being alone because there are seasons where you'll basically transition from one group of friends into to another and it's not even a group of you'll usually transition from a group of friends into no friends and then you'll find one or two people who are at a new level and then sometimes those people introduce you to some of their friends and if you keep walking and you keep outpacing then that group will then start retiring past you and then maybe one person stays with you

00:06:47	maybe no one does and you'll have another lonely period I'm saying this because I used to think that there was something wrong with me when in reality I just didn't understand what the nature of being exceptional meant and so I'm saying this purely from a definitional perspective to be exceptional means that you are the exception it means that you are not normal and so it's normal for normal people to find you abnormal if you do things that are not normal don't let people who have mediocre goals deter

00:07:20	you from taking actions that make you great because it makes you different realizing that I thought most people actually made no sense they say they had these goals but they took no action and they called me work obsessed and they would tell me I should take time off and they're like hey you're not you're not you're not as cool anymore you're not you're not hanging out with the boys like why aren't you participating in the fantasy league why aren't you watching football on Sunday with us and for me I

00:07:42	actually used to love watching football uh with my friends it was actually one of my biggest things that I look forward to but the thing is is that like I needed that Sunday because I had to prep workouts I had to prep the music list for the next day I had to run billing I had to do all this other work and the thing is is that like I looked at that football game and I was like my goals are more important to me than this and so I think that a lot of people don't actually look at themselves in the

00:08:02	mirror and say like one year from today will I will I remember this football game or I remember the fact that I'm not where I said I wanted to be and to me that was significantly more painful now this is an uncomfortable fact for a lot of people your ability to delay gratification is actually a function of intelligence and so your ability to learn at a longer and longer delay is something that comes I mean we're talking from primates all the way up and so basically if you want to teach a monkey how to do something you have to

00:08:34	say hey do this thing and immediately give them a reward and the longer that period goes on the less trainable they are the sign of intelligence is that you can actually expand the reinforcement window and they can still abstract it back to the original action if you want to practice intelligence then being able to actively delay your need for a result or reward from the work you do will make you a more intelligent person because your rate of learning will actually increase despite the fact that your

00:09:06	reward rate will decrease in the short term and so to give you full transparency on what 2025 might look like if you accomplish your goals at the end you might have a different friend group or no friends at all for a season because you don't become like the people you admire you become like the people you want to impress Harvard made this you know Wonderful study years ago about the best predictor of someone's long-term material success was what they called their reference group now this has been misquoted in places by The Five

00:09:37	People You spend the most time with but it's actually The Five People You compare yourself to and that's a very big difference now I want to take it a step further because I think to myself what are the things that affect our behavior and so it's really about the people that you want to impress not necessarily even who you compare yourself to because it's the people whose voices you hear when you're about to make a big life decision and so when you make a big life decision you don't listen to the people closest to you you

00:10:06	should listen to the people closest to your goals and some of them may not be in your neighborhood or your city or your state or your high school or your college they might just be people you follow on the internet and you have to abstract what would that person think about this decision not my mom not my homie not my uncle or that person at church and so I think this is a great transition of thinking through instead of necessarily even having mentors having Heroes and transposing what you think their decision-making calculus

00:10:36	would be onto your life and so it's interesting is that I will have conversations with entrepreneurs and they'll say hey here's my current condition this is my desired State this is what I perceive my obstacle to be and I say okay well what do you think and they're like well I think you're going to say I should do X Y and Z and I'm like you're right why aren't you they're like well and the thing is is that basically what they answer with after that well is in essence other people's opinion who aren't at the place they

00:11:04	want to be here's the the uncomfortable truth which is that Winners focus on winning losers focus on winners and you never receive hate from above always below because winners have their eyes on the goal not on other people and so you have to decide whether you want to be a loser or a winner and I'm just being real with you what this looks like in reality and maybe for you in 2025 will be like this first you look like an idiot to everyone else while you try to figure it out then everyone else looks

00:11:33	like an idiot for ever doubting you seasons and so everyone takes a different amount of years to stop giving a about what everyone else thinks and if you're going to get there eventually you might as well start today and enjoy the benefits longer so if I'm 855 years old I think about what that man cares about and that man cares about very very little all you have to do is talk to an elderly person or a grandparent and be like what do you think about this a lot of like ah who cares like it doesn't matter life is

00:12:02	literally Too Short they literally don't have time for it and so I think to myself if that's the ultimate version of me if I'm going to get there eventually and that's what the wisest people think after having the most life experience then why would I not try to cheat code that into today and then not have to go looking back from 85 and think man I wish I knew then what I know now look forward to 85-year-old self and say I am going to choose to learn the lesson I know I'm going to learn and act as if I

00:12:30	knew it today because the difference between them and you is that what they consider work you consider life and so you have to accept that you have a fundamental different understanding of how life works and I believe that is a more accurate view of reality the reason that the rich can get richer is because they see the world differently than the poor and so it makes sense that if your poor friends don't see what you see that they see through the lens of poverty and all my goal in life is to be able to see

00:13:01	reality more accurately and so in the beginning you have to develop this armor this thick skin around people saying those little snide comments of like you work too hard you're too obsessed you have a toxic work capacity and why are you working weekends why are you working late nights you're you're not like this is not worth it they're not paying you enough for the work that you do all of these different things because eventually that armor on the outside actually just becomes one with you and you don't even hear hear it anymore

00:13:30	because I can promise you that those people who were in my life decades ago they're just not even I don't hear those those claims anymore for two reasons one because my reality changed so drastically that they couldn't say anything and secondarily they're just not in my world anymore I was only able to get here because what they deemed acceptable I deemed intolerable how far you go in life I truly believe this is based and predicated only on one thing which is your actual standard and so I believe that the person who runs any

00:14:05	company or runs any division should be the person who has the highest standards and if there's ever a day that someone has a higher standard for acquisition. comom than me they should run this instead of me because they would be the one who's best serving the company and so the person who should have the highest standard for you is you and so it makes sense that they have a lower bar but why would I listen to their bar on my life I think that that standard is the one thing that rich kids get from

00:14:32	Rich parents more than anything else it's because they have an expectation of Life they don't accept opportunities that are below that standard and so they actually get their huge leg up on the pick on the vehicles that they choose to pursue and so one of the tougher Parts if you're not from an area where people make a lot of money or not from you don't know anybody who's a you know super successful entrepreneur is that you basically have to borrow someone else's measuring St and you have to say is this the standard

00:15:01	that Elon would pursue is this the standard basos would pursue is this the standard jobs would pursue if it isn't then why are you doing it if you want to be like them then act like them if you want to be like your friends then you can act like your friends but don't be surprised that you have what they have or lack what they lack if we're thinking about elimination we're eliminating bad friends and tangentially their opinions about you that are affecting your behavior so the next thing or what

00:15:28	things are playing interference on your time and your attention all right so I would say opinions of other people are affecting your behavior and your decisions I think that your environment affects your efficiency of behavior so think about how much more you get per hour of output if you can't sit still ignore notifications and focus on one task for eight hours straight never expect to build anything great and as uncomfortable as that is it's also the truth like I I don't know a single incredibly successful entrepreneur that

00:15:59	can't sit down and have hyperfocused periods of time sometimes weekends weeks at a time where they don't talk to anyone and they just hammer away and it's whether they're coding for software or they're making some insane marketing campaign and all the email follow-ups and all the text follow-ups and and the affiliate uh you know promotions and incentives or someone who's creating a product that they're designing and they're in the shop and they keep tweaking at it or there's somebody who's who's hyperscaling a company and saying

00:16:24	I'm going to sit in 20 interviews a day for for 7 days straight so I can hire 20 people this this week because I need to get going right like if you can't sit still and ignore notifications and focus for a day nothing great will get accomplished because it's not about what you want it's about what's required and it's and whether that's your best or not is irrelevant it's just there's a price tag and you got to be willing to pay for it or you don't get the thing and a lot of times it's not what you want and I I

00:16:53	I I spend a lot of time trying to dispel the concept of like Follow Your Passion because I think it leads more people astray then it helps because it's very easy for someone who's successful who's already delegated tons of things to only then focus on their area of genius and then say here for my seat do what I do but there's a very big difference between doing what someone does and doing what they did to get there and I think this is what's lost in a lot of the content that I see in the entrepreneurial space

00:17:19	and to be clear whenever I'm trying to get to the next level I often have to take on things that I don't know how to do and I have to learn how to do them which means I have to suck for a period of time and sucking sucks but the thing is is you have to be able to embrace that period of time and say like this is the cost of greatness and so I'll give you something very tactical so I have timers in a lot of my offices and my team has adopted this too which is I like to time block which is essentially

00:17:42	saying how long do I think this is going to take and you can do this on a week scale you can do it on a daily level it depends on the level of project you're tackling but for me even on the most micro level I say okay how long should this take I'll then crank this thing Boop I think this should take 20 minutes and then I hit start and I let the timer go and if for whatever reason something distracts me I pause it so that I know that I didn't actually work that period of time and so what happens is it will

00:18:09	give you a very real look at how long you're actually working versus how long you think you're working and you tell other people working and you Instagram how long you're working and as I've become more efficient at work meaning my output per unit of time has gone up I've realized that there's just been a significant decrease in the distractions that I allow to interrupt me again if you want to stay focused staying focused is not like zeroing in and saying I'm going to do it just like I'm going to

00:18:36	I'm going to I'm going to just zoom in on this thing it's more that Focus occurs when you remove everything else what's left is focus and so Jerry Seinfeld has this uh this famous process that he talks about with writing and I think writers are also wonderful people for talking to for deep work because it's the nature of the work they do one of the things that he did and he has done for years for his standup so he can script it out is that he locks himself in a room that has no windows and has nothing but a

00:19:05	yellow notepad and a pen and he tells himself that he has to go in that room and he doesn't have to write but he can't do anything else and so what ends up happening is that writing occurs as a default and so Focus kind of works the same way you eliminate everything else by to create Focus you don't try and push harder while also having these disruptions so there's three easy ways that I make my phone less distracting the first first is I switch it to grayscale and so grayscale decreases consumption across all people by 30% is

00:19:35	and that's research back it's pretty cool the second thing is turning off all notifications across all apps on your phone because you never want your app to be dictating when it's convenient for the app to disrupt you like how ridiculous is that but we let apps have that permission most phones and people want to push notifications to you I want to pull them when it's convenient for me the third thing is other people and so I have a mode on my phone where no one can get through and when I do that then I

00:20:07	can reach out to them when it's convenient for me because if it's actually an emergency call 911 and if it's not a true emergency then it can wait and my team wanted to remind me that I don't email I heard in uh I think it was like 2016 that Bill Clinton didn't use email and I was like if he's the president he doesn't use email I cannot use email and so uh my team doesn't contact via email and so if you can eliminate entire channels that's also an easier way to concentrate uh fewer flows of communication and here's

00:20:39	the thing it's always harder takes longer and costs more than you think it will that is a reflection of poor expectations not that the reality is bad and so it makes sense that it would be harder take longer and cost more because if it didn't then everyone would have it and everyone had it then it wouldn't be worthwhile and so literally the difficulty of the task that you embark on is proportional to the reward that you ultimately get because you are the asset that you build more than the achievement and so if it's

00:21:10	hard that's amazing because it will make you that much harder once you conquer it and it will also make it harder for anybody else who wants to follow in your footsteps and so the higher up the mountain you climb the thinner the air gets and the rarer the climber or Explorer must be in order to get there and so I don't know about you but I would so much rather climb a mountain that so few people have been able to climb so that I can see a view that other people haven't seen and So speaking of expectations let me talk

00:21:36	about the worst expectation of all which is entitlement which is the expectation of life or other people to give you something without earning it and I think that this is is a is a virus in today's culture right now and so there's the famous quote Hard Times create strong men strong men create good times good times create weak men and weak men create hard times it makes sense that right now we have a lot of weak men because it's been pretty good times the good news about that is that it's so easy to beat them you just have to show

00:22:09	up be on time prepare the night before remember people's names actually follow up when you say you were going to and try like you mean it rather than trying like you want to get credit for trying and I see this is this this thing that's that that's pervasive right now is that people will comment or they'll DM me and they're like hey I'm trying really hard as though I'm supposed to give them credit for trying the world doesn't work that way it gives you credit for achieving and the reason that you want

00:22:39	credit for trying is because you want it to Cost Less take shorter time period and be easier and so if you restate your complaint about the difficulty as oh I have false expectations about the ease or the price tag of this goal then all of a sudden you realize that the only real problem was that you expected it to cost less it's like going to the store and being like oh I've got these Jordans that I really want to buy I got $50 I'm so excited to buy them you go to the store and and see that they're $300 at

00:23:10	that point you can just say Jordans aren't for me or you can say oh I will have to keep working and keep saving so that I can afford this and so it's a lot about affording the goals that you want to achieve and a lot of things that we have to spend in order to get them is the time and the rejection of not achieving what we want on the time line we originally thought like what makes success hard is that the expectation that Society puts because we only see the Highlight re you actually only see people after they finish the race people

00:23:39	think success is like watching a marathon not running a marathon when you watch a marathon you look at the beginning and you look at the end it only takes you a couple of seconds to see both of those but running a marathon is four or five six straight hours of breathing heavy wondering when it's going to end counting starting to play games in your mind of like okay I'm I'm 2/3 of the way there I'm two two more quarters of that I'm only 1/ fth of the of 1/8 of the way there and you keep doing this to play tricks on your mind

00:24:08	to keep going but the thing is is that in a mile marker race it's very clear to know how you're going to get to the finish line and how long it's going to take the only difference with success is that you just have to keep running and you don't know where the finish line is and people will only cheer you on at that finish line that they don't know where it is either which means you have to get used to running alone and so the difficulty is you have to start running and you have to keep running but you

00:24:32	just don't know whether you're running for a mile or 300 and so this is where the pacing is important so a lot of people will run really hard they'll they'll think because they only saw the beginning of the marathon on TV and the finish of the marathon on TV that they can just Sprint because both of those clips only lasted a couple of seconds so they start their marathon of success of whatever it is they're going after by sprinting as hard as they can and then they realize that there's no one around

00:25:00	and there's just a bunch of open road ahead of them and they're like how long is this going to take and that's when reality sets in and so I make these videos to say that a lot of times it's going to take longer so one of the big nasty things that you have to eliminate on this path is the identity that you have about yourself the isms that you claim and so for example like Oh I'm a I'm a neat freak I'm a I'm not good at math I'm not techie and so you make these statements and they don't serve you fundamentally you should have one

00:25:35	razor that rules all decisions and I this is this is pretty cruel but it's also the reality of the world which is does this thing person belief make it more or less likely that I hit my goals and so if you run every single thing you do the actions you take the people you hang out with you having your phone in the room you saying I'm not techie does this increase or decrease the likelihood that you hit your goals and I'm not saying this to preach cuz I had one that I dealt with for a long time so I always

00:26:07	considered myself to be bad at math I remember I was decent at math and then in nth grade I had a really bad teacher and it basically put me back a year basically after algebra I didn't really learn anything because the year after that I didn't have the the foundations from the year before the difficulty was I kept saying after that point I'm just not good at math but when I was in my 20s I made the decision that that didn't serve me anymore and so I was like okay well what would I have to do to feel

00:26:34	like I was good at math and I was like well people would like can do math in their head I think that's a pretty cool thing and so I didn't use a calculator for anything for years and then I learned I mean I made a lot of mistakes in the beginning but then I got better and better at doing math in my head and I would check it obviously after I was done but I always let my head try and do it first and so nowadays if you were to ask people man is Alex good at math they're like dude he just rattles off

00:27:00	numbers like crazy but the thing is is that until I was in my 20s I thought I was bad at math and so it's like we are so much more pliable than we think we are and we had something that set us on a trajectory a little bit earlier in life that just gave us maybe a little bit of disadvantage fine because you just have to get over it everyone's childhood was difficult and if you want to win the award for hardest childhood congrats you win you feel better right no one cares about what happened to you

00:27:27	then only what you can make happen now identity is a lie we only describe people about who they are by what they do doing is being and so if you want to be somehow different you have to do different things and then only afterwards will people describe you based on the actions you take think about back in the day the actual names people had was he's John the carpenter he's John the stonesmith he's John the Mason right people literally had their names based on what they did that hasn't changed the first thing you do when you

00:28:03	meet somebody is you find out what do what do you do and that gives you indications and if you want to describe who someone is what do you say you describe what they do and so this means that our identity is 100% under our control because we control what we do and then only after the fact will other people describe you in that way so we covered environmental things like with the phone and having a timer we covered interpersonal things in terms of our identity and voting with the our dollars and time about the things that we care

00:28:28	about we eliminated the bad people and their opinions about us that affect our behavior and so we've eliminated all these things so now we've made room to get started and the good news is you only need three things to win the balls to start the brains to learn and the heart to never give up and the best thing is you already have all three and for the girls you have goads so it's fine it still counts and so my ask of you is to make the commitment now this is again the elimination of alternatives

00:28:58	to make the commitment to never stop and so it doesn't mean that I'm asking you to commit to be successful I'm asking you to commit to keep running to keep walking the marathon even if you have to pant and you have to slow down you just can't stop and so the best way to hit next year's goals is to not wait until next year to work on them it's to start now because I'll tell you this if you feel like you need a special occasion to begin making your life better then it assumes that a special occasion must

00:29:28	always be there for you to want to improve yourself it shows that you don't think today is worth improving and so that means that you typically will always cast forward when you think things are worth improving and so the easiest way to vote with your action is to make today the only day that is good because it's the only day you have control over my hot take which shouldn't be is you don't have to wait until January 1st to better yourself and I'm purposely posting this before the year ends because I think it's stupid to wait

00:29:59	like why would you wait on getting better why would you like if you had a lottery ticket why would you wait to cash it in you would cash it in as fast as humanly possible and that lottery ticket is the life that you want on the other side of this why would you wait here's a harsh truth you're young you've got time false all that lie does is extend how long it takes people to realize tomorrow isn't guaranteed nothing is going to be easy get over it it takes time to get good and the sooner you start the sooner you act and the

00:30:31	sooner you act the sooner you get and don't stop until you do and as harsh as that sounds I do have good news it only takes 20 hours of focused effort to get decent at anything the problem is people wait years before they start their first hour so many of you could probably start achieving next year goals before the end of this year 20 hours is not that long if you're like man I really want to learn ads I really want to learn how to make content I really want to learn how to edit videos I really want to learn

00:31:00	how to sell you can do that now and you can have that skill like we can onboard a new sales guy in in a few days there's this massive delay that people think because of the unknown they don't know what is going to happen and so they therefore assume that it's bad and so the reality is that most people don't like surprises even if they're good ones have you ever heard people like oh I don't like surprise parties it's a party why would you hate a surprise party that's in your favor you hate it because you don't like the

00:31:31	unknown and so it's a really good thing to test for yourself which is why would I hate a good surprise you hate it because there's a possibility that the surprise is negative but on a long time Horizon you know 85 year-old you isn't even going to remember it to begin with this is a this is going to be a weird one for you but just stay with me if you've ever been so drunk that you're throwing up and you think to yourself man I'm probably not going to remember this the good news is is that once you do succeed that

00:32:03	terrible period of vomiting or whatever the difficulty is that you're going through it'll actually compress in your mind and so as difficult as it may seem in the moment it actually doesn't stay with you all you'll have left is the thing you accomplished you won't remember the work that it took to get there there'll be a significant discount on the punishment you endured I tend to have a bad habit of really not looking back very much and so I occasionally will go through my photos and I am reminded about all of the mistakes and

00:32:33	the detours that I took along the way to where I wanted to go and I'll tell you the story that my father told me when I was uh very impatient he said listen you think that this is taking too long for you to be successful he said do you know how long it took me to become a doctor and I was like no he's like well so my father's a run in and he left the country to get educated and there was a program for anybody who's running that the government would pay for your schooling as long as you came back with

00:33:03	the education now the revolution occurred during the time he was away so he actually never got to go back he went to uh France Paris to try and enter medical school only problem he didn't speak French and so he's trying to do Premed in another language as somebody who doesn't even share the same alphabet and so he failed that year he then took a the second year he tried again because you're allowed in in in France it's a different system you can just basically try as many times you want he started

00:33:31	again and the second year he failed again and then he talked to his brother and he's like I don't know if being a doctor is for me like I just fa like imagine this like failing two full years in a row and his brother said hey why don't you to go to Belgium you know change the environment you know different different School different people go there so he went to Belgium and then in his third try he made it past his first year now mind you at this point he had two years of learning French and so he was able to finally

00:33:59	actually understand what the professor was saying so was it that he wasn't smart enough to understand how to become a doctor or was it that he just had other skills that he lacked along the way and so a lot of people right now are judging the fact that they didn't succeed because they somehow think it's some innate trait I'm not smart enough I'm not good enough but sometimes you just lack some prerequisite skills right like if you're like trying to learn calculus and you've never done arithmetic before it's going to be

00:34:25	really hard right dare I say imposs possible and so if you jump straight into calculus you're not going to win so sometimes you have to take two steps back in order to build the foundation to get forward now I'm going to keep the story going so he then graduates in uh you know seven years because how long it takes the actual medical school system is different in in in in uh in Europe they actually do college and the the next degree all is one thing so seven years later he graduates okay then he's

00:34:53	this Iranian dude can't go back to his own country meets a girl in Belgium she says I'm from the US and so he comes back to the US with the lady who would eventually become my mother and when he's in the US he then his doctor his his MD doesn't apply here so he then has to basically do it again in the United States and in order to do this you have to get a residency now getting a residency as someone who's a foreigner back then was pretty tough and so it took him two years where he had to basically work minimum wage jobs he was

00:35:27	like uh you like run slides like Radiology slides back and forth as like a runner a courier when he was a full surgeon but he couldn't do it here in the US and so imagine how masculina it is right where your wife comes back she's able she was a US citizen and had all this other stuff right and she could she got her interpret immediately because uh she was us and she was a girl whatever and my father didn't and so he then had to do two more years where he didn't have progress so he he told me this whole story and then eventually

00:35:57	obviously he got the he got the residency and then he he was able to get in the path but if you look at that he basically had four or five years of his life where there was basically no net gain in progress towards his goals and so he's telling me this story when he's 50 and he's like look at my life now he's like no one knows he's like no one asks me how long it took they just know what I have now and what I can do now and so you have this idea that it's that it should take a certain period of time

00:36:24	it it should only last this long it should be this level of difficulty but the thing is is that that level of perseverance when he decided to go out on his own and start his own practice rather than and and left the practice that he was working in he then didn't know anyone and he still had a heavy accent was a new guy in a new area and it took him time to build up and what did he do my dad learned how to be a general contractor he built his own Surgical Center because he couldn't afford having these Outsource third

00:36:51	parties that charge $250,000 to build a surgery center he buildt his his for a fraction of that and so as my dad going to Home Depot measuring and figuring these things out as a full plastic surgeon it's not about the resources you have it's about how resourceful you're willing to be right now getting started is 100% under your control and I love taking this Frame which is that every self-made billionaire is self-made now if you're like wait there are billionaires who aren't self-made right that's why I didn't say all billionaires

00:37:20	every self-made billionaire is self-made and every self-made millionaire is self-made and here's the one people hate every self-made person in poverty is self-made now that may make you feel uncomfortable and you know what you may be right you probably did have more disadvantages you probably did have things that worked against you and now what you're right so that's it then for you the rest of your life will never go the way you want to go the harsh truth here is if you want to feel better blame

00:37:54	others if you want to get better blame yourself and so my father told me that story multiple times in my life as I'm sure your fathers have told you stories multiple times in your life or you had a parent or an uncle or a brother and they told you those big meaningful stories and so I'll tell you another time he told me it so after I lost everything for the second time think about like I tell the story but it's very easy to gloss over but think about this I had left my job went to a new area didn't

00:38:25	know anyone started a gym didn't have enough money to have an apartment slept at my gym just Grassroots got it going made the gym Successful by working there every hour of the day was finally successful enough to be able to open a second location a third a fourth a fifth a sixth finally feel like I I taste success like I'm actually doing something I'm actually pretty good here like that bet that I made actually paid off and then I lose it all and so I I I sell all those locations I put the money

00:38:52	in a new thing and then it's gone and so I could look back and say wow I just spent all those years and I actually have nothing to show for it the only thing I would have had to show was the money that I made but my father retold me that story and he said it was never about the amount of failures failures he had it was about the education that he had and so one of the other repeated father isms that he gave me was that education is the only thing that no one can take from you the skills you have

00:39:21	the skills you acquire along the way are the only thing that are truly yours there's nothing else in this world world that actually belongs to you your your clothes can get stolen the belongings you have and he said this from a place of reality which is my family came from a country that took all of our assets They seized everything They seized land They seized homes They seized wealth they just said oh yeah all that that's ours now good luck this may not be as real for people in the United States but

00:39:52	having people who everyone in my family had everything taken from them that is very evident in how they talk to me and how I've always seen the world as these things are ephemeral these material Goods the studio the setup the lights the whatever the platforms like gone but the thing is is that my father came here with a ,000 because of the Revolution and had nothing and built the life he has and you can lose it all and gain it back and so we've seen so many entrepreneurs who've actually lived through this cycle

00:40:24	it's actually a common thing in entrepreneurship and it's because you have to understand and respect risk the beauty of it is that after you fail the likelihood that you're successful goes up not down this is the part that people Miss they fail and think it somehow decreases the likelihood of success but it actually increases it and so it's like you want to just get the failures out of the way why would you not want something that increases the likelihood to your goal and the reason that it increases that likelihood is that

00:40:50	failure is a requisite probability for taking action and so anyone who has failed has taken more action than someone who's done nothing which means it increases the likelihood that they are successful and so when you fail you get feedback and when you get feedback you get better and when you get better it increases the likelihood you win losers stay losers by never being willing to lose everyone loses before they win and so there's this great Moment In The Matrix which is the the famous jump where Neo is trying to jump across the

00:41:23	buildings and everyone's gathered around because they think he's the one he obviously takes the jump and he falls and they're like H what does it mean what does it mean and Cypher who ended up eventually being the Judas of this says everybody falls the first time and so even the one or the person who was going to become the one was somebody who had to fail first and I love that because everyone Falls the first time your first business is very unlikely to be your last business the first product you have will be a product that you'll

00:41:53	be embarrassed of years from now but what's important is having the product getting the product building the product launching the product shooting the shot and so if you're never willing to lose you're never going to win so in 2025 if you start a podcast or you start making content or you start doing cold outbound or you you you you take a new job whatever it is just remember that your second try after you fail which you inevitably will takes twice the emotional effort but half the actual effort so you'll fail and you'll

00:42:22	emotionally feel bad but guess what you did you actually gripped your hands on the unknown and you go from unknown optimism to known pessimism so it's like okay now I know what it takes I now have realistic expectations what is required in order to be successful and although it may be bigger than I originally thought I now can quantify what is required to win and so here's the thing the best entrepreneurs in the world have the biggest failure resumés and so I don't even want you to win I want you to

00:42:55	build your failure resume and so if you're like must be easy for you to say I lost money on my first two real estate deals I ever did almost lost all the money I put in I've lost money on crypto when I put it in years ago I lost money on uh bad hires I've lost millions in bad hires actual hard costs not soft costs I've had six failed businesses I've had nine failed Partnerships and so I bring these things up because like you're not going to hit it out of the park on the first shot but the crazy

00:43:22	thing about how success works is that you only need to win once that's the crazy part is you only have to win once once I'll read you this quote from Jeff Bezos which is what I started my first book $100 million offers with we all know that if you swing for the fences you're going to strike out a lot but you're also going to hit some home runs the difference between baseball and business however is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution when you swing no matter how well you connect with the ball the most runs you can hit

00:43:49	is four in business every once in a while when you step up to the plate you can score 1,000 runs this longtail distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold Big Winners pay for so many experiments and when he says big Winners pay they pay in failures they pay in the scars that they have to incur and endure along to hitting it out of the park and hitting it out so big that they never have to swing again and so I want to make this as real as I possibly can I just found an old note from myself

00:44:22	to myself that's 12 years old and so I talked about my $10,000 per month income goal and reading it got me actually pretty choked up this is all to say that no matter where you're at in your journey you've just got to believe with all your heart that you're going to make it because no one else is going to believe for you because you can never expect someone to invest in you more than you invest in yourself and the crazy thing is some people say they'd kill for a shot or theyd die for a chance when in reality they won't even

00:44:50	wake up 60 minutes earlier for it so we've eliminated the distractions all of the things associated with not doing this stuff and now now hopefully I've removed some of the mental BS around getting started and so now once you start you got to get better connections money looks intelligence those are all great but you can beat someone with all of those things if they have only one trait an insatable desire to improve no matter where they start it's hard to beat someone who improves every second of every day without giving up and this

00:45:23	is why earlier I said ambitious people buy skills and they pay for those skills with time and money and in order to have the time and money to invest in those skills they have to take them from somewhere else because the thing is is that your resources are zero sum and this is something that a lot of people aren't comfortable with whatever you choose to spend your time on you take from something else whatever you choose to spend their money on you take from something else and so most people don't

00:45:48	have a resources issue they have a priorities problem you are choosing to say that other things are more important and hey I want to be real if that stuff is is more important to you than amazing you want it life congratulations but if you don't have what you want and you're spending money to proliferate a life that is not the one you want to lead then you need to shift the list to invest the time and money and pull from those things that you don't want to put more in the ones you do and do you want

00:46:15	to starve out failure so think about this one of the easiest ways to to have more money is to work more hours you're like how is that possible well when you work more hours it actually kills two birds one is that you actually make more money when you work more hours but on top of that you don't spend money because you have less time to spend it and so every hour of work is a net positive in two directions so it saves you money you're not spending and makes you money and so you want to find those

00:46:46	little twists that you can make in your Investments of time and money that are outsized it's not just that you gain you also stop the loss I've always been willing to bet bid big on me and so a lot of you guys are trying to like bet big on Dogecoin or some meme thing or like some get rich quick and I promise you the guys who have all the money know how to do it better than you and if you have your last thousand or 5,000 or $10,000 that you're like what do I do with it bet on you cuz you'll never sell

00:47:15	you you're a long-term hold right and so if you get better you guarantee the win and every investment you make compounds you guarantee compounding because every skill stacks on top of other skills Steve jobs talked about how when he went to college and learned calligraphy was the reason that fonts showed up in the Mac later and so he talks about you can only connect the dots looking back you want to double down on investing more into you getting skills and I'll tell you something that you probably don't

00:47:42	know so I spent $110,000 and I only had 50 saved up after years of being a consultant so I had $50,000 saved up as 23 years old as my life savings I spent $10,000 to get a gym coach I joined a mastermind for gym owners fun fact though I didn't have a gym but I figured if I go to a mastermind of gym owners I'm going to learn so many of the things that they made mistakes on when they started their gym they're they're going to have opinions on how I should lay out the square footage what what locations I

00:48:13	should pick what model I should use and so rather than say oh I'm just going to find out all these failures on my my own and and take five times as long I was like I'd rather pay $10,000 to pull 5 years forward into the present and so I was able to get that first location up and profitable and outsourced by month 9 now some of the guys in The Mastermind were at year five and still hadn't done that I pay down my ignorance tax as much as I possibly can because the cost of you not being able to achieve your

00:48:43	dreams the price is ignorance and the debt that you pay is the distance between where you are and how much you'd be making if you knew how to do it I I've told the story before but I think it's so it's it's something that's so ingrained how I think in terms of how I price what I'm willing to pay in time or money and before I tell that story I move geographically whenever I see an opportunity to get around someone who's better than me and so when I wanted to learn Fitness stuff I moved to an area

00:49:12	where I knew there was other Fitness entrepreneurs that I was like well maybe I'll be able to hang out with them a little bit and I'll learn a little bit there and I went to a city I didn't know anything about I knew no one and when I wanted to when I wanted to uh get in the gym space I said well California is like the capital of Fitness SoCal so I'm going to move out to Southern California because the best guys will be there and if I can win there I'll be able to win anywhere and so I moved out to

00:49:32	California without knowing anyone whenever I've had these big transitions in my life is not only being willing to bet with my money and bet with my time but I also bet with my geographic location I'm willing to risk losing the relationships that I had to gain relationships that I need and so 2025 for you might mean that you have to leave where you're at and that could mean across town but it could also mean across the country or even across into a different country it mean that you're going to spend take all this money that

00:49:58	you used to spend here and spend it an entirely different way you probably are going to have less stuff and that's okay because that stuff only deteriorates it only gets worse but you will only get better don't invest in Dogecoin don't even invest in the S&P 500 invest instead in the 500 invest in you because you will always beat a 10% return in the stock market and if you think that Dogecoin is going to out compete your personal growth you're never going to win anyone can get rich fast as long as

00:50:30	you're willing to make no money for a long period of time while you work to get good enough to get rich fast and so I told you I'll tell you that story The Story Goes Like This a guy is actually using this as a sales close to an audience he wrote a million dollars on a whiteboard in front of an audience and so then he called out to a lady in the front row and he said how much do you make ma'am and she said $50,000 and he said okay well right now you pay reality $950,000 every single year for not knowing how to

00:51:04	make a million dollars and when I saw that I realized that the value of the skill of making a million dollars is the difference between what I'm making and what I could be making and people wildly undervalue how much more they could be making once they have a skill and so if you're the type of person who can actually follow instructions show up on time smile be able to fail and keep going virtually all education will net you a positive yield because let me ask you a question would you pay $950,000 to make

00:51:38	a million dollar and be able to make a million dollar every year well that would be an insane deal you pay it once and you get the skill forever so every year after that you make a million dollars a year well of course you should now once you make the million do a year are you willing to give a 100% of what you make to make $10 million a year of course you should and that's why education is by far the highest return you can learn how to make a million dollar a year for probably close to $200,000 year and you're like well well

00:52:06	where where do I spend that you'll spend that on conferences you'll spend it on seminars and it'll likely be in 2000 to to 5,000 sometimes $30,000 chunks but for some reason you're willing to spend this on some academic who hasn't been in reality for 20 years cuz they're on tenure and thinks that the world uh is just going to hand you stuff because that's their reality because they're government funded or you can pay money to people who live in real private businesses who do this stuff for a living and here's

00:52:39	the thing I have never paid for education and not gotten more than what I paid for now I don't want to conflate that with the fact that I've paid for things that I didn't think was worth that money to other people but I always ask myself okay number one how can I become the best student who's ever gone through this how do I become this person's number one success story and I've told every program every partner every vendor that I've ever worked with I will be your biggest success story and so the reality is once I am their

00:53:09	biggest success story is that because of them or because of me and I think that's a choice that you get to make am I going to be the number one success story or do I want to be right and prove that they're not good well congratulations maybe they're not that good well what does that leave you with no skills and less money if you choose to succeed anyways and say what can I learn from this person because I've learned just as much from bad people as I have from good because a lot of times getting good is

00:53:36	actually the removal of bad and so if you find out other ways that people do a terrible job it's also a wonderful way of figuring out how to not do a terrible job and so if I want to create a product that's exceptional and I say let's say I want to put a phone a camera the internet email all in one place if you remove all of the stuff that sucks from all of those things what you're left with as an iPhone most times you can always get more than what you pay for when you invest in you so let's get

00:54:04	really tactical if you really want to double down on you which will bu far I mean think about this 10% Improvement is the S&P 500 so you're saying that you could take okay let's be real Let's do let's do real math so let's say that you've got $10,000 saved up okay let's say that's what your savings is which by the way makes you like a top 40% American FYI so let's say you've got $10,000 saved up you could put in the S&P 500 and have that $110,000 be$ 10,900 one year later or you can spend that on something that can triple your

00:54:43	earning capacity and next year instead of making let's say $50,000 a year you make $100,000 a year well which of these increases the $50,000 plus increase is more than the net of the 900 because you lost the 10 you spent the whole thing here you invested it here you spent it but did you spend it or did you invest it an asset you could control and so I don't know about you but I'd rather have the extra 50 and put the 10 in and then what do I do next year I'm going to take this 50 and I'm going to ask myself is there

00:55:20	anything I could put this $50,000 into so I could put in the S&P 500 and I could go and add myself an extra uh $5,000 $55,000 whatever let's say I get 10% that year okay so I get 55,000 this year or I could put that 50k into 10 5 10K things or 2 25k things and all of a sudden take my earning power from 100K to 250k wow what a deal but I'm going to lose the whole 50 again and so the thing is is that on my way up I basically took my savings and I spent it almost every year on education because why on Earth

00:55:54	would I want the future to take longer to get to me when you buy skills it's the closest approximation to buying time and so there's this big thing like you can't buy time false you can buy the future at a discount and you buy the future at a discount by buying the skills required in order to get there faster and so if it could take you five years if you did it on your own or it could take you one year if you paid four different people to help you out with each step of the process why would you

00:56:22	not want to pay all of the money you have to get to there and then have four years of gain with that new Baseline you now are living four years 5 years into the future it's like you skipping from being 20 to 25 and you getting the earning power at 25 plus but now you're just 21 and then when you're at that point you pull the next 5 years for it and when you're 22 it's like living like you're 30 right like now at that point though you might spend all your savings yet again and this process has been one

00:56:47	that I have consistently done for the entirety of my career and it just gets to a point where you can't even spend the money and so my very controversial advice is spend all your money on education for as long as you possibly can until you can't even spend the money because you're making too much of it and so how do you become an expert you do more repetitions than anyone else in a narrow field which also means you fail more times than anyone else in a narrow field and so if you want to beat someone

00:57:15	just try 10 times harder than them and you only really need to try two or three times harder but you probably don't realize how much harder they're trying than you are so try 10 times harder just a make make sure you win people reject this idea that someone can work 10 times or 100 times harder but I Define work as output and so for you to say that someone can't produce 10 times more than you is just factually false there's tons of people who produce 10 times more there's tons of people who produce a 100

00:57:44	times more than you I'll give you the easiest example in the world a lot of departments run on weekly cadences they say do this thing by end of week often times you can ask that person how many hours will this really take you and then that person will say something like I don't know 3 or four hours you say okay well why don't you just get it done by noon and then at noon you say okay what's the next thing going to take and they'd say uh probably another three or four hours you say cool get it done by

00:58:08	the end of the day now from those two cycles that would have normally taken two weeks or 14 days but instead it got done in one and so just right there you got something done you got 14 times more done than the competitor who's doing things on a weekly basis and so this is how you drag the future to the present is that you're not focusing on hard you're working you're focusing how much you're getting done you'd be amazed at how much better you get after you've done it 100 times if you want to win do

00:58:37	it again I want to be clear you don't just post 100 videos in a row and see what happens you post one see what worked and then try and do more of that thing and so the idea isn't just raw effort it's raw effort with an improvement Loop and so I remember one of my favorite words that I have to teach sales guys cuz the repetitive task to teach someone how to sell is great do it again great again great job again and so it's that repetition that breeds the Nuance of skill and you want it to be so drilled into you that you no longer have

00:59:12	to consciously think about how to do the thing because you can then do it as a natural skill so you can move on to putting your attention to the next skill so it's not just about learning how to do it once it's about learning how to do it so many times that you don't have to think about doing it at all it's especially if you're starting out your goal should not be passive income mainly because you don't have enough money for the passive income to mean anything instead you should learn how to make

00:59:35	money while you're awake before trying to learn how to make it while you sleep you crawl then you walk then you run once you have more money than you can possibly reinvest in education and acquiring more skills then you can take the leftover and put that into your passive income poll and so very very tactically this is what I walk you through you should have an education investment budget and so just like you spend x per month so let's say you we pull all of your expenses down and you're making an extra ,000 a month okay

01:00:03	now if you're not eating out you're not buying new clothes you're not going out with the boys you're not spending money in stupid ways that if that's what you're doing then you're going to have $1,000 left if you have that then you can take that money and every month you can put it towards a bank account that you can either choose to immediately spend or save up for something that is more expensive and I can tell you that a lot of what I learned when I when I bought program programs and seminars and

01:00:27	conferences and things like that wasn't even from the content itself but it was connections that I was able to make at those types of events that I was then able to Leverage The One skill I had which I was good at sales and then start giving that away to every person I met so that I could collect those IUS and then learn skills for free and so it's like I really just needed a ticket to get in the room and then I could trade with everybody else with the skills I had to then get to learn theirs and so

01:00:54	as wild as this sounds at the end of 2025 you could be dead broke but rich in skills and so let's say at the end of next year you actually have no more money but you now have the ability to make more money and so just like my father had to start over from nothing after losing everything he didn't lose everything he still had the most valuable thing he had which is that he was a surgeon and so he knew a skill and he could make it work here like he'd make it work there and that is something that no divorce can take from you no

01:01:22	government can confiscate and it's something that's with you till the day you die and so that's how you get better you keep going you keep improving the feedback loops you invest appropriately and you keep going all in on you we've eliminated everything that's bad we've started something that's good we've gotten even better at being good and now finally we've got to stick to it when it gets tough because it will here's something that's taken me way too long to learn staying focused is like beating

01:01:47	addiction it's not a one-time Victory you have to fight it all day every day then wake up and do it again tomorrow because the thing that's going to distract is going to change every day the thing that's going to trigger your addiction to distraction is going to keep morphing and changing its form so that it can steal or Rob you of your future and so you have to be adaptable in knowing that you have to fight it every day and so it's not good enough to just say I was focused for this week you've got to wake up on the eighth day

01:02:16	and the ninth day and do it again and so you remember that guy who uh got rich Drop Shipping and day trading and uh buying crypto and wholesaling all at the same time yeah me neither Focus to win in business you need to be able to say no without remorse and hear no without a loss of enthusiasm which means that you have to keep feeling rejection keep failing and keep going while being willing to reject basically everyone else and that seems so counter because you're right there and you're like man I

01:02:51	don't want to reject this person because I know what it feels like to be rejected you need to be able to maintain this discrepancy so that you can create the space to do the work that needs doing so there have been a couple of lessons that I have learned over and over again in my career I've had to relearn so it's a lot like a like a fine wi it's like it it gets better with age and there's more Nuance to the flavor so I think focus is not a are you focused or not it's how focused are you and you can measure

01:03:18	someone's focus by again the quality and quantity of things that they say no to which means that as you get better more opportunities will emerge which is interesting because people who start out can't see opportunity anywhere and it's because they have so few skills and so there's very few opportunities for them when you have a lot of skills there are so many opportunities that are in front of you that you feel like you're missing out but the real opportunity is actually in solving the problems in front of you

01:03:45	I was able to in my opinion become another order of magnitude greater in terms of Entrepreneurship which I would just me measure by wealth once I was able to learn to say no and accept that I would not be able to pursue the many things that I know I could crush because once you realize how much actual work it takes to make something good you realize how few things you're actually going to be able to do in your entire life and so this is why picking becomes so important right now the things that you're going

01:04:18	to have to say no to are really the distractions and kind of in some ways easy say not to Fantasy Football say not to drinking beers with the boys going out with the club whatever but in a year from now once you have more skills there will be more opportunities you're going to have multiple $10,000 month income opportunities that you're going to have to say no to to stick with the one that you have and then once that things becomes a $100,000 a month thing that you're doing you're going to have to

01:04:39	start saying no to multiple $100,000 a month opportunities and here's the thing with opportunities that come up they only show you the upside and not the downside you have to know where the skeletons are buried you have to know where the bodies are if you don't know and I've gone through this this this visual because I think about it every single time I have to walk through not doing something you are here you see this new opportunity here then you understand the downsides here then you live the downsides then you experience

01:05:10	the upside then you achieve your goal and so this is the starting point this is called uninformed optimism this is now informed pessimism this is the value of Despair and this is where most people quit but what they do is they don't even quit because they don't want to say they quit what they do is they start another one of these things and they say oh this is now my uninformed optimism and then oh now I understand this more but the thing is is that they never actually get through to this upside and so they just

01:05:39	keep jumping from thing to thing to thing over and over again and so the reason it takes so long is because you're in a rush big things don't happen on small timelines because you have to start from zero over and over again and if you actually stick with it it's actually the shortest way to get to where you want to go go it just takes longer than you think must be easy for you to say is probably something that you might think by watching this or listening to this and I like to tell the story because in July of 2017 is when I

01:06:09	started my podcast and it was 90 days after I lost everything the last time and from that point until now it's taken that period of time to get to over a million downloads a month and for the first three years and I was making multiple we're talking 3 400 episodes for the first few years I never really cracked 3,000 downloads a month and so I could say man why is this taking so long but the real real is that it took me that long to get good it also being extra real took me that long to have proof on the outside that what I was

01:06:45	saying was true on the inside and right now no one who listens to my podcast cares that it took me seven years to get here they just care that it's good today and so people quit here when things get hard because the thought of something being hard forever is unbearable they think that this line is just going to keep going this way forever but it's not because once you fully understand all the bodies where the skeletons are hidden then you can actually start solving them one by one the thing is is

01:07:13	that that distraction only is distracting because you don't know what sucks about it you might think you know what sucks about it but you don't know what sucks about it and so the big difference is you have something called declarative versus procedural knowledge and so there's two types of learning and this is actually formal this is uh this is from Academia so you have declarative knowledge which is knowing about something so if you go memorize a fact or you you you learn how private Equity works right this is knowing about the

01:07:44	other type of knowledge is procedural which is knowing how to and so a lot of people mistake declarative knowledge for procedural and so they mistakenly think that if they watch 10 videos on doing a private Equity deal that it means they understand how to do a private Equity deal or they watch 10 videos on cold outbound and they think it means they understand how to do cold outbound or 10 videos on sales and so forth but you're never really going to learn how to do it until you do it and so you're going to

01:08:16	learn more from your first hundred cold calls your 100 cold knock on doors then you will from a hundred books or videos that you watch but I have good news nothing hard lasts forever there's only three things that can happen you either quit it gets easier or you get better so no matter what it always ends you only lose when you quit before you see it all the way through and I think that's incredibly encouraging so no matter how hard whatever it is that you're doing is which by the way just means that your

01:08:47	expectation doesn't match reality but no matter how hard it is you either quit it gets easier because something changes externally or you get harder something changes internally but no matter what it will end think about it like you're you're mining for gold right you're you're chiseling away underground and you've got this pile of gold you don't know how far away it is but it's underground and you're digging towards it this difficulty of swinging the the the pickaxe can end when one you walk out of the mind and say there's you know

01:09:15	what marketing doesn't work sure the second is that all of a sudden you hit a soft patch and then you're like oh my God I'm digging so much faster now this is great and then you get to the gold or you just start swinging the axe harder because you get more muscled you get more efficient with your movements and you just keep chiseling away even if it goes from dirt to rock you just keep chisling away at a slower Pace but you eventually break through and get there but in all three of those scenarios hard

01:09:43	doesn't last forever and so I'll give you a little rule of thumb that I've seen on how do how do I do more of what's working right how do I keep going when it's easy do more when it's hard do different and so I told this story years going I'll tell you guys again so when gym launch just barely started to work all right so I'm like 3 months into gym launch working guess what guess what brilliant Alex thought he should do so I went to this Meetup of 10 entrepreneurs all the entrepreneurs were eight figure

01:10:08	entrepreneurs so 10 million plus per year I was not making that I we were pacing probably $3 $400,000 a month at the time it was just me ilila and I think we had an assistant over kitchen sink right so it was I was making the most money I'd ever made in my life and probably to this day because it was the most material change in my life by percentage when you go from no money to hundreds of thousands a month within 90 days me looking at bankruptcy attorneys 6 months earlier to that it's I can't I

01:10:34	can't explain how crazy reality shifted but I had this guy who came up to me after I gave my little presentation of like hey this is what's working and so of course what I want to do now is start a supplement company he came up to me and he said if what you're saying is true if the economics of the business that you've outlined really do work as well as you say they do when it gets easy is when you go hard it's when you double down on what's working and he said that to me and I remember he said

01:11:01	because what's going to happen is that if it really works this well someone bigger and batter is going to take all your stuff and immediately try and do it with their distribution Their audience and their leverage and so if there's ever been a time to focus on the thing that's in front of you it's right now and I remember Leila and I felt this huge weight of pressure that started us at that point because literally I think I was I was really content for like six weeks and I was really thrilled we had

01:11:28	just gotten married we're six weeks into being you know married we're making really good money uh she's 23 or 24 I'm 26 or 27 so like we're young I was like holy cow this is amazing our rent for contacts was $1,200 a month I was taking home 400 right like and so I've always lived far below my means at this point though we went back home with the devil inside of us in terms of the fear of us losing everything that we had and so we basically worked around Around the Clock like someone was trying to put us out of

01:11:57	business and the thing is is that people did eventually but by the time they did we had gone so far ahead that they were way behind us because we were working against a hypothetical enemy who was trying to destroy us not the ones that were actually mediocre and distracted when it's easy do more once it starts working put the blinders on and hit the gas and I would challenge you with this tactical setup right now if you've never worked for 30 days straight I would encourage you to try it in China there's

01:12:28	something called the 996 which is basically the standard for Chinese Tech work hours which is you work 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. 6 days a week that's the bar and so I like to state that because we think we work so hard that's just the average and so I would encourage you remember Hard Times Hard Men right good times well we need to act as though it's hard times because if you don't you're surely going to become soft my challenge for you is work 30 days straight work 10 work 12 hours a day 30 days straight what you

01:13:02	will realize at the end of this is one how much work you can actually do two that you're not going to die you're not made of glass and third you'll know that you have that gear if the time calls for it now I will be very real with you I work more now than I have ever worked in my life save maybe when I opened my very first gym so I work in absolute hours more than I ever have and I produced significantly more than I did then and this year I think I've taken something like 10 or 11 days off in 2024 I would

01:13:36	measure a day off as any day where I worked probably fewer than 4 hours I put this as context and I had a I had a security guard who was here at acquisition. earlier this year and he was talking to uh some of the younger guys on the team and he said you should never let Alex work more hours than you because he's already ahead of you and so if you want to catch up with him certainly don't let him outw work you some of the hoodoo mental health whatever people are going to disagree with me also don't give a and so

01:14:16	the thing is is you can just go and make those mental health people happy or you can get what the you came here to get you can do what you came to do and I have found that in my life I've gotten significantly more purpose and more drive from a Long Day's hard work from earning my shower at the end of the day than anything that I've ever had from a pleasure seeking perspective as much as it's great to go to the pool for a day and hang out with some people or maybe just watch movies as great as that may

01:14:49	be there's nothing that I get more filum out of than knowing that at the end of a day that I work 16 straight hours that I have some product that I pulled out of my brain and into the world that this thing got life now looking back on the best days of my life it was those types of days and so when I realized that I stopped trying to satisfy what everyone else told me my life was supposed to be like they're like you should take vacations I took my first vacation this year and it was supposed to be a two-day

01:15:20	vacation and Lila and I left after one because what happened was I got there at this beautiful Resort $5 or $10,000 a night very expensive and I I say that just to say that it was ritzy right it was luxurious I get there I sit out on the back of this beautiful patio for this really expensive room and I look out on this you know Mountain View and I think to myself this is beautiful and I don't care I wish I felt something and all I wanted was to get back in the game and so I realized that even that little

01:15:52	mini vacation was something that I had done because I thought was an expectation it was unspoken or spoken from someone else in my life and so I have this quote that I live by which is if you don't know why you believe what you believe it's not your belief it's someone else's at that time it's like I had this belief that I should take a vacation but why now if I can't explain it which I really can't then I shouldn't do it and now I want to be very clear this doesn't mean that there's no time for rest but I like to think about the

01:16:22	hypothetical extremes I like to think about the 996 that that is just the standard in China and I like to think about people in the Middle Ages and the Dark Ages they worked above their shop and they didn't have like the 7-Day or 5day work week is something that was invented in the last 100 years this is not pointing to your human capacity this is pointing to a societal constraint I think that a truly liberated individual operates purely from first principles of what do I want what does it take to get

01:16:52	it and then what are the things that hold me back and those those things that hold you back are going to be physical constraints you can't operate without sleep not for an extended period of time so I'm not saying don't sleep sleep as much as you can I'm not saying that you can work physical labor all hours of the day without rest you need rest and sometimes you need mental rest which is different than physical rest and that's okay so if you need and I'm going to put need in quotes here if your way of

01:17:17	unplugging is watching Netflix cool if your way of unplugging is gardening cool if your way of unplugging is working out cool do what works for you but but fundamentally the goal is to increase total net output over the longest period of time and so it's not about okay I'm going to work 24 hour straight well you're actually going to take from tomorrow so your net output over two days is going to be much worse and so it's really balancing that and I learned that much later in life I was able to get significantly more out of myself

01:17:45	working s days a week and working 10 hours 12 hours on those days rather than working call it 18 every day that was for me a little bit bit too much now I have had Seasons where I call three shifts so basically I work 6:00 to noon noon to 600 and then I work 6 to basically sleep time when I get back home I only usually have to go into that gear probably once a year for maybe 6 weeks to 8 weeks is when I have to go into the third shift but most of the times I can pretty much sustain 12 hours of work a day kind of indefinitely I

01:18:20	bring this up to kind of set the bar for at least where I'm at so maybe you have some sort of benchmark but if you're wanting to get ahead I can promise you working less is probably not the way to do it especially when you don't have as many skills because the fewer skills that you have the more labor or volume you have to compensate with in order to make up for the ineffectiveness per unit of time you work and so in the beginning is when you actually have to work the most but in the end is when you want to work the

01:18:48	most because of how much more you're getting for it so my team wanted me to make this point because they've obviously seen me work and they're like I don't think this is coming through in this video which is that I have an obsession with speed this seems kind of weird in justos with patience but this is the very classic micro speed macro patience you know whatever whatever whatever ISM you prefer the idea is though that you want to pull reality forward and so I always like to break things down whether it's me or my team

01:19:13	into how many hours and minutes something's going to take and then I like to stack those things back and forth and rather than using arbitrary deadlines of okay let's get this done by next week you use actual deadlines based on how long long it should take and then when you find out how long something takes you then ask the next question which is how can I make this take less time how can I automate this thing how can I automate portions of this work how can I how can I give away chunks of this

01:19:36	how can I deem some of this unnecessary and so that continuous cutting and pulling forward of tasks is how you can move so much faster through life and towards your goals and so I have this weird mental belief that there's like this this big path in front of me that I have all these skills that have to achieve to hit these Milestones that is laid out on this time span and so I reject the timeline but I accept the skills and so the idea is like okay it's like I'm a Pac-Man of like eating those little dots and each of those dots is a

01:20:07	skill it's like I want to pull it towards me as fast as I can so I can so I can ingest the skills and basically power up myself faster because I know that these skills are requisites I can't move on to calculus without knowing arithmetic I can't move on the calculus without knowing algebra there's no way around it but I can choose to learn algebra faster and so then it's like okay what is required to learn algebra oh and if I do more problems faster then the standard person then I'll get there faster and so if the class says okay I

01:20:36	need you to do these 10 problem sets and they're due next week well then how long does it take for me to do those problems maybe 30 minutes then why can't I do my second lesson 30 minutes later and then do another 10 problems and do my third lesson 30 minutes after that and do another 10 problems well if that's the case then I can do an entire Year's worth of work in a week and this is how in my opinion pulling forward is one of those things that I've seen so many of the most successful entrepreneurs do is

01:21:04	they simply question timelines aggressively and ruthlessly eliminate any waste or gap between the actions required to win and everything else honestly I think the things that I'm working on right now for my skills are I'm learning how to reinforce cultural norms across a company that continues to scale which I Define as the rules that govern reinforcement in an organization that is the culture and those are both spoken and unspoken rules and when I say rules I mean when someone does this they get a

01:21:41	pat on the butt when someone does this they get uh chastised or they get a ding right and the thing is is that people like to say they have a good culture here but the culture is is is hundred thousand unspoken rules and that's why it takes people time to learn and figure out what the culture is when they go somewhere new you can give someone a list of a 100 rules and if you were very granular you could figure it out the problem is that the culture changes based on the people who Chang the reinforcers and so that means that the

01:22:12	culture in a team could be different than the culture in the company because the person who's closest to them uh manages it differently and so that changes the behavior and so that's why a sales team can have a different culture than a marketing team a different culture than a finance team different culture than than an HR team and so I'd say right now a big focus of me of mine is trying to standardize the rules that govern reinforcement across an organization that scales and making sure that everyone is aligned with that style

01:22:38	of work the second thing that I'm working on right now is basically the highest level of recruiting and recruiting and talent is actually kind of like Focus where it's one of those skills that I don't think you ever Master you just keep learning how many more levels to are to it it's like right when you finish you realize that you're at a sub Peak and there's actually another Peak Beyond it the Mist lifts and then you see the next steps and so like Focus I thought oh I was focused at $100,000 a month because I could turn

01:23:04	these opportunities down and then you got some even sexier opportunities you got to learn how to say no to those so the same thing happens with Talent is that you're willing to tolerate a certain amount of mediocrity at one level that is no longer tolerable at a level above that and the types of people that you bring in you have a higher standard a higher bar for those people and attracting them in the process associated with getting them to buy into your culture your vision and getting them to take their skills and apply them

01:23:27	to your opportunity is a skill set that I am working on now because fundamentally I have a belief which is the best talent is always yet to come and that's predicated on the idea that if I get better my opportunity will get better and that will attract more people and better people and I bring this up because I basically want to translate one thing which is that the reinvestment in learning skills never ends and so Charlie Munger said this you just have to be a lifelong student you have to be willing and want to learn so actually

01:23:55	had um an example of this so recently there was somebody on uh teams I did a bunch of one-on ones uh over the last week because I was looking at one of the Departments and uh one of the one of the guys said hey I have this particular skill I was hoping that we could eventually have a a role that only does this thing and I said you know it's interesting that you that you ask or you make that request because if I were you I would not think that way at all I would think how could I learn 10 more skills rather than how can the

01:24:22	organization meet my demands it should be how can I let my skills meet the demands of the existing business it's asking reality to meet you where you're at rather than meeting reality where it is and I think that too many people do this why can't the world insert be more convenient for me well the world is uncaring and doesn't care about you at all and underline underpinning that statement is the entitlement is the expectation that it somehow should and I think that is a poverty lens and so the

01:24:49	wealthy accept the world for what it is and then choose to maximize and adapt everyone else else tries to stop their feet and throw tantrums and say how it's not fair and they're right and so what there's a Haitian proverb that has nothing to do with cats and dogs that I think is relevant right now which is behind mountains are more Mountains goals aren't Finish Lines they're mile markers and I think that's a great mental frame which is that you think that your goal is to get to $10,000 a month or $100,000 a month or a million a

01:25:21	month or 10 million a month whatever your goal is and I can promise you having hit those you just move it again you just the Mist lifts when you get there and you realize there's another mountain top but where people lose their way is when they start listening to people at the bottom of the mountain who see them at the subhead and say you weren't happy last time when you got to the last Peak why are you going to be happy the next time but that's under their assumption in their poverty lens that you did it to get to the

01:25:46	Mountaintop you did it for the climb and they'll never understand that and don't expect them to I remember I was trying to understand this person who had made this really irrational decision and I kept thinking like how how does this decision make sense and I was I was talking to my father actually and he said you're trying to apply logic to someone who's illogical and that itself is illogical and I remember thinking about that is that like there are these people in our lives that say these things that

01:26:16	you're like I don't understand why they'd say that and then you try and make sense of it but the effort of trying to make sense of somebody who doesn't make sense is nonsensical and so if it doesn't make sense to you ignore it because they're going to disappear anyways one of the things that has been true in my life is that the lazy don't know how to start the losers don't know how to finish and the Legends don't know how to stop and if I look at that the lazy the loser the Legends I know which

01:26:43	one I would rather be and I also say that as somebody who doesn't believe in Legacy or anything after we die so this is tactical find what works do more of what works find the thing that's preventing you from doing more of what works solve that thing and get back to doing more of what works then repeat and so the reality is that in health marriage business or any game worth playing you don't win by winning you win by Staying Alive long enough that you Outlast everyone else so I will give you the advice that I gave a sub group in

01:27:16	school that we picked 100 people who had applied out of 500 plus to basically do a 90-day Sprint to help them start a school community so we wanted to do a more in-depth kind of training things like that for this special group so that we could see if this new implementation yielded better results and so the guy who we had running the group asked me he's said can you give any kind of like words of wisdom to these guys before we kick it off and so this is what I told them number one follow instructions

01:27:40	number two When You Reach something that you don't understand how to do Google first number three when you figure it out post it others also may have struggled four actually follow the rule of 100 daily which is that you reach out to 100 people you make a post that you spent 100 minutes on spend $100 plus on ads and you spend at least 100 minutes a day making and improving ads and researching ads as long as you do those things consistently and you get better you will see results and the amount of

01:28:12	you that I see who tag me in like day four day 20 day 30 the guys who are at day 60 of rule of 100 are like I have more business than I can possibly handle the problem is no one sticks with anything and this is why I want you to stick with it rule number five five you will be excited for a week then excitement will end and that is where the work begins six your work works on you more than you work on it you are the product that's getting built more than anything that you're actually putting into your business remember that seven

01:28:41	everything is unscalable in the beginning that's the point it's how you learn every piece of it and once you learn every piece of it people will call you an expert eight the pain of repetition is what forces you to see seek Improvement when you figure out ways to get more for what you do you've gained skill people want to avoid the pain one of my favorite bodybuilding coaches Milo sarv talks about this in the context of how to grow a muscle he says find the pain and then he'll just shout he be like suffer suffer he's like

01:29:14	stay there find the pain because the thing is is that that pain is what forces you to change and so if you encounter the pain and then say Oh it's not working that's the pain that you need to lean into because when it's not working is what will force you to do an improvement and that's how you get good at making better content get good at making better ads get good at having more effective reach outs on different channels whatever it's that pain that forces you to improve nine if you complain you are dead to me and I said

01:29:46	this because I believe it like there is nothing weaker and more helpless and that has lower agency than someone who simply complains about what has occurred it's something that happened in the past or is in front of them in the present and regardless complaining literally does nothing it's a net zero it's a net loss you both lose the energy that you could have spent improving and you also lose respect from every single person that you complain to and they will associate the complaints with you they

01:30:21	won't remember what you complain about only that you complain 10 literally thousands of people have already succeeded you are not special repeat the same activities and you will be able to repeat the same outcomes before you make a conclusion that something doesn't work I want you to State the objective truth of what you're claiming you're like Facebook ads don't work sure so the 400 billion a year in advertising that gets spent on Facebook just somehow doesn't work people aren't doing it because it's

01:30:50	not working cold outbound doesn't work yeah so the gazillion companies that do 10,000 emails 10,000 calls a day they just it just it doesn't work what you have to reframe it as is I don't know how to make it work I am not good enough to know how to make it work because you're not making as much money as you want because you're not as good as you think you are 11 write down every reason that you're going to stick with it put it in front of you and revisit it when you need a reminder of why to stick with

01:31:20	it 12 business is shockingly simple but surprisingly hard hard the hard comes in the form of consistency the moment you don't want to do it or just skip today is the day you realize what hard actually feels like learn to endure overcome 13 just win because at the end of the day all of this hardship will be forgotten it will fade into your memory and so know that as you're going through it you're actually just going to disproportionately in your memory remember the good stuff and not the bad stuff I only have a few glimpses in my
