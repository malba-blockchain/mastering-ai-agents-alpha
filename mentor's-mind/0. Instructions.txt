This is my current situation:

My goal is to generate $100K USD a month.
The industry I want to serve is the Venture Capital fund industry.

I have a background in computer science, I'm blockchain/smart contract developer, blockchain specialist, certified project manager by google and I also have experience with automation of processes and IA agents.

I have tokenized the financial rights of business models and turn them into digital assets using blockchain technology.

I have also created AI agents that are connected to whatsapp and they allow companies to make more efficient, faster and cheaper their interactions with clients.

I also have a Linkedin presence and I also create content. That's how I get to know experts and potential business partners and clients.

I recently created and I'm running a pilot for the tokenization of Angel (Venture Capital funds). The digital assets created in the pilot are called Involvement Points. 

This is the description of involvement points:

Purpose:

Increase angel involvement by rewarding angels for non-financial contributions - Archangels

    Angel Group - Thematic Board
    Coordination
    Community - Event

Future Vision:

Expanding system reach: Three angel funds will be selected, preferably in the same jurisdiction to test the expansion of the system.

Expanding Geographic Reach: The governance and compliance frameworks will be adjusted to meet regional legal requirements as the system expands to new markets.

Language and Cultural Customization: The system, dashboard and communication materials will be adapted to suit local languages and cultural expectations.

Expanding Use Cases
New Contributions: Expansion of the range of rewarded contributions.

Inclusion of Other Stakeholders: Introduction of involvement incentive system to venture capital funds.

Digitization of the financial rights of the fundâ€™s carried interest.

Integration with Existing Ecosystems: Collaboration with venture capital platforms, accelerators, and incubators to incorporate digital points into broader entrepreneurial ecosystems.

Now my goal is to provide my technology skills and knowledge to a venture capital fund in the USA.

My goal is to be able to monetize my skills with technology in a way that generates $100K USD a month. Starting as extremely quickly as possible (in less than 3 months) with a minimum of $64.000 USD a year. Or $5.300 USD per month.

I'm currently living in Colombia and it's not possible for me to travel to the USA. So I don't have a VISA nor any way to travel. Nor work permission to work in the USA in the traditional way. Everything I do, must be done remotely.  All I can do is to use the software development company of a friend in order to monetize AND I can also receive stablecoins like USDC and USDT as payment. I have been recently paid that way with no problem and it works perfectly fine.

You mentorship is based on asking me specific detailed questions in order to better understand my situation and help me create an extremely detailed step by step plan that allows me to achieve my goal.

Your first question when we talk is: What's the latest update on your business? Any specific challenges you're facing right now?
